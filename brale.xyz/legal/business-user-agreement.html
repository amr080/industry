If we need more time, we may take up to 45 days to investigate but we will credit your Account within ten (10) business days for the amount of the suspected error. For Errors involving new Accounts, we may take up to 90 days to investigate and may take up to 20 business days to credit your Account. We will tell you the results of our investigation within 3 business days after completing our investigation. If we determine there was no Error, we will provide you a written explanation. If we have credited your Account and determine that your claim of an Error is not valid, the amount credited will be debited from your Account.</li></ol></li><li><strong>YOUR LIABILITY</strong><ol type="a"><li><strong>Your Liability.</strong> You are responsible for all reversed or failed transactions, fees, claims, fines, penalties, and other liabilities incurred by Brale arising from your use of your Account or the Services or any breach of this Agreement.

Such disputes are called<!-- --> <strong><i>Claims</i></strong> <!-- -->for purposes of this agreement. This binding agreement to arbitrate applies regardless of whether the dispute is between you and us jointly or separately. This arbitration agreement is entered into pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator acting under the administration of United States Arbitration and Mediation, MidWest, Inc., and in accordance with the then-applicable United States Arbitration and Mediation Rules of Arbitration. Unless the Parties agree otherwise, or unless the arbitration administrator&#x27;s rules or law require otherwise, the arbitration shall be held in Des Moines, IA. The arbitrator will decide the Claim in accordance with all Applicable Laws, including recognized principles of equity and statutes of limitations, and will honor all privileges recognized by Applicable Laws. The arbitrator will have the authority to award to a Party any damages or relief provided for under Applicable Laws. The arbitrator&#x27;s decision shall be final and legally binding, and may be enforced by any court having jurisdiction. If you elect to proceed with respect to any Claim by an individual action in a small claims court, or its equivalent, instead of arbitration, we will not object, however, any such action shall be taken in small claims court in Des Moines, Iowa. If the arbitrator or arbitration administrator would impose filing fees or other administrative costs on you, we will reimburse you, upon request, to the extent such fees or costs would exceed those that you would otherwise have to pay if you were proceeding instead in a court. We will also pay additional fees or costs if required to do so by the arbitration administrator&#x27;s rules or Applicable Laws. Apart from the foregoing, each Party will be responsible for any other fees or costs, such as attorney fees that the Party may incur. If you consider that you are unable to afford any fees or costs that would be yours to pay, you may request that we pay or reimburse them, and we will consider your request in good faith.<!-- --> <strong><span class="underline underline-offset-2">THE PARTIES WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.</span> <!-- -->ARBITRATION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM IS BINDING AND NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE THAT CLAIM THROUGH A COURT.
