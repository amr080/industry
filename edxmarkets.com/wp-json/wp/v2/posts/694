Industry leaders, regulatory experts and financial innovators gathered to discuss the pressing issues and transformative strategies shaping the institutional digital asset ecosystem. EDX was a proud platinum sponsor of this year\u2019s event.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>EDX Chief Commercial and Strategy Officer Jeanine Hightower-Sellitto moderated the panel \u201c<em>Building Institutional Grade Digital Assets Infrastructure.<\/em>\u201d The discussion featured a lineup of industry leaders from Cohen &amp; Company, Axon Trade, AlphaPoint and Blockfills, who delved into the emerging standards and practices essential for constructing scalable, robust and secure infrastructure to support institutional adoption of digital assets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the city\u2019s rich financial history, Boston was an appropriate setting to underscore the conversation on the rapidly evolving digital asset space. Key takeaways from the panel included:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Institutional-grade infrastructure for digital assets is now on the verge of mainstream adoption. <strong>Asset managers, RIAs, wealth advisors<\/strong> and other institutional players are increasingly integrating these technologies into their portfolios.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The industry is rapidly evolving to support key features already commonplace in traditional asset classes, such as <strong>colocation, FIX connectivity<\/strong> and <strong>central clearing<\/strong> through innovations like EDX\u2019s central clearinghouse.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Institutional adoption of crypto is driving advancements in <strong>brokerage, lending<\/strong> and <strong>custody solutions<\/strong>. These developments aim to integrate seamlessly with both existing legacy systems and the emerging digital asset ecosystem.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Institutions are <strong>actively preparing policies and procedures<\/strong> to not only engage with existing crypto assets, but also to accommodate the <strong>next wave of tokenized real-world assets <\/strong>\u2014 a development poised to redefine asset ownership and liquidity.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For EDX, this event was more than just an opportunity to connect with peers: it was a platform to champion our mission to bring trusted, liquid and efficient venues to the crypto space. By emphasizing institutional-grade reliability, scalability and compliance, EDX is at the forefront of shaping the future of digital asset infrastructure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re excited about what\u2019s to come and look forward to attending future events.
