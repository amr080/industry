Additional major cryptocurrencies, such as Solana and XRP, will be listed in the months following launch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>EDXM Global\u2019s new perpetual futures venue is located in Tokyo at Equinix\u2019s TY3 &nbsp;data center and fortified by a central clearinghouse and single net settlement process, which reduces the upfront capital required to trade and minimizes credit risk. The venue also has a unique bankruptcy-remote structure that enables members to retain ownership of their currency deposits. Accessible via GUI or API, the venue will begin client onboarding this month.

Kono also brings over 10 years of experience from traditional financial firms such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kono is joined by Chief Compliance Officer Rakesh Madamanchi, who was previously Head of Compliance at Blockchain.com. Madamanchi\u2019s background includes over 15 years of legal and compliance experience at global banks including Wells Fargo, ANZ and Standard Chartered Bank. Kono and Madamanchi are based in EDXM Global\u2019s Singapore headquarters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jamil Nazarali, CEO of EDX, said, \u201cEDXM Global\u2019s perpetual futures venue will provide clients with a safer, more streamlined experience that reduces costs and improves both capital and operational efficiency. We\u2019re excited to launch this new business and have complete confidence in its success under Kai\u2019s leadership.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kono commented, \u201cI am thrilled to lead EDXM Global\u2019s growth in APAC and to help accelerate the adoption of digital asset strategies for institutions in the region. Many of these firms have long had the desire to enter this space, but have been reluctant to do so given the perceived risks. Now that EDXM Global can deliver crypto derivatives trading within a familiar, secure trading environment, I anticipate strong interest from a wide range of participants.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About EDXM Global<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>EDXM Global is a fast-growing digital asset trading venue for institutional clients that leverages best practices from traditional financial markets on a purpose-built crypto platform.
