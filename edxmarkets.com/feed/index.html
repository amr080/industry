<p>The Hedgeweek APAC Digital Assets Summit 2024, held on December 4 in Singapore, gathered thought leaders and innovators to explore the rapidly evolving landscape of institutional digital assets. EDXM Global CEO Kai Kono and Head of Institutions Kal Chan proudly represented EDXMG at the event, hosting a roundtable on the topic of “Institutional Adoption in the Digital Assets Market.”</p>



<p>Kai and Kal led an insightful conversation addressing the catalysts enabling more widespread acceptance among traditional finance players and the critical role of infrastructure and service providers in supporting institutions with reliable, secure and scalable solutions.</p>



<p>Key takeaways from the panel included:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Institutional Adoption is Accelerating: </strong>Family offices, asset managers and financial firms are integrating cryptocurrencies into their portfolios, driven by increasing regulatory clarity, innovative product offerings and advances in blockchain technology.<br></li>



<li><strong>Regulatory Shifts are Catalyzing Growth: </strong>The appointment of crypto-friendly regulators and pro-crypto political leadership in the U.S. is fostering an accommodating environment for institutional growth globally. This trend signals optimism for more robust international participation in the digital asset market.<br></li>



<li><strong>Tokenization is Unlocking New Value Streams: </strong>Tokenization – or converting traditional assets into digital tokens on blockchain platforms – is being explored by institutions as an avenue to increase liquidity and capital efficiency.<br></li>



<li><strong>ETFs are Opening the Door to Crypto: </strong>The launch of Bitcoin ETFs and other crypto-related investment products is simplifying institutional access to digital assets. ETFs have become the most common entry point for asset managers and family offices to allocate digital assets into their portfolios. From here, firms often expand into options, futures and structured products to hedge overall exposure and increase risk-adjusted returns.<br></li>



<li><strong>The Future is Bright (But Not Without Challenges): </strong>The convergence of traditional finance and digital assets suggests a transformative period ahead. We can expect to see enhanced stability for major cryptocurrencies, broader adoption of tokenized assets and a more integrated global financial system down the road. Nevertheless, concerns around regulatory compliance, security and market volatility remain critical considerations for sustained growth in the sector.</li>
</ul>



<p>For EDXM Global, participating in events like the Hedgeweek APAC Digital Assets Summit is essential to fulfilling our mission of building institutional-grade infrastructure for digital assets. By driving conversations around innovation and adoption, we remain committed to bridging the gap between TradFi and the financial industry’s digital future</p>

<p>The 3rd annual <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/boston-institutional-digital-assets-forum-2024-tickets-949448615367">Boston Institutional Digital Assets Forum</a> took place on December 3 at the iconic Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Industry leaders, regulatory experts and financial innovators gathered to discuss the pressing issues and transformative strategies shaping the institutional digital asset ecosystem. EDX was a proud platinum sponsor of this year’s event.</p>



<p>EDX Chief Commercial and Strategy Officer Jeanine Hightower-Sellitto moderated the panel “<em>Building Institutional Grade Digital Assets Infrastructure.</em>” The discussion featured a lineup of industry leaders from Cohen &amp; Company, Axon Trade, AlphaPoint and Blockfills, who delved into the emerging standards and practices essential for constructing scalable, robust and secure infrastructure to support institutional adoption of digital assets.</p>



<p>Given the city’s rich financial history, Boston was an appropriate setting to underscore the conversation on the rapidly evolving digital asset space. Key takeaways from the panel included:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Institutional-grade infrastructure for digital assets is now on the verge of mainstream adoption. <strong>Asset managers, RIAs, wealth advisors</strong> and other institutional players are increasingly integrating these technologies into their portfolios.</li>



<li>The industry is rapidly evolving to support key features already commonplace in traditional asset classes, such as <strong>colocation, FIX connectivity</strong> and <strong>central clearing</strong> through innovations like EDX’s central clearinghouse.</li>



<li>Institutional adoption of crypto is driving advancements in <strong>brokerage, lending</strong> and <strong>custody solutions</strong>. These developments aim to integrate seamlessly with both existing legacy systems and the emerging digital asset ecosystem.</li>



<li>Institutions are <strong>actively preparing policies and procedures</strong> to not only engage with existing crypto assets, but also to accommodate the <strong>next wave of tokenized real-world assets </strong>— a development poised to redefine asset ownership and liquidity.</li>
</ul>



<p>For EDX, this event was more than just an opportunity to connect with peers: it was a platform to champion our mission to bring trusted, liquid and efficient venues to the crypto space. By emphasizing institutional-grade reliability, scalability and compliance, EDX is at the forefront of shaping the future of digital asset infrastructure.</p>



<p>We’re excited about what’s to come and look forward to attending future events. Thanks to all who attended!</p>

<p>EDX Markets, an institutional crypto trading venue with a central clearinghouse, had record volumes on its US spot crypto market as it prepares to launch a perpetual futures venue in Singapore.</p>



<p>Jamil Nazarali, chief executive of EDX Markets, told Markets Media that the growth in spot volumes has outstripped the increase in  market volumes. “Since the end of the third quarter and the US election we have seen incredible growth and there is strong sentiment in the market about the future regulatory environment,” he added.</p>



<p>EDX provides separate quotes&nbsp;&nbsp;for institutions and retail intermediaries and&nbsp;said it has traded and cleared $39.8bn of member volume since the start of this year.

<p><em>By Jamil Nazarali, CEO and John Fennell, Chief Risk Officer &amp; Head of Clearing Operations</em></p>



<p>When we speak with prospective <a href="https://url.avanan.click/v2/___https:/edxmarkets.com/edx-markets/___.YXAzOmZvcmVmcm9udDphOm86MzgzZjRlMWMwYjUxOTdkNzNmYTIxYWQ2MzliMDUxZWI6NjoxM2FmOmJkYTZiODEyOTY0MjBjMTNiN2VkODU5MThmODQyNjUxMTEwYmZkYjdmMDAwOWQ2MmU5NDMyODFjMTdhODVmNmY6cDpUOk4">EDX Markets</a> participants, one of the first things we ask is what they’re looking for in a trading venue. The answers vary, but they often boil down to one key factor: efficiency.</p>



<p>These financial institutions tend to value forward thinking, so they are willing to embrace innovative structures that enhance their digital asset trading experience. Almost invariably, they are looking to reach more counterparties, trade at higher volumes and secure better executions. At the same time, they value the responsible, trusted structures from traditional markets that enable them to operate at scale.</p>



<p>It’s fitting, then, that one of EDX Markets’ biggest drivers of value, delivering safety, security and efficiency, is our central clearinghouse.</p>



<p><strong>From Security to Efficiency</strong></p>



<p>Today, EDX Markets is the world’s only centrally cleared crypto trading venue. Integral to how our institution-only marketplace functions, EDX Clearing unlocks unique operational and capital efficiencies for our trading members.</p>



<p>In our conversations, financial institutions have an immediate positive response to our clearinghouse. As principal to each trade, EDX Clearing greatly reduces counterparty exposure risk by ensuring timely and certain settlements each day, drawing from its committed default fund if necessary. Our risk management processes are inspired by best practices from the world’s most sophisticated exchanges and institutional trading firms. Beyond these concrete benefits, our central clearinghouse represents a commitment to stability and responsibility, giving our members peace of mind that we offer a safe environment for trading.</p>



<p>What isn’t always immediately understood is the power of our clearinghouse to drive efficiency. Our mission is to operate the most trusted, liquid and efficient crypto trading venues available, and our clearinghouse is integral to all three pillars. Whether in the form of delivering flexible settlement processes or enabling members to collateralize trades with liquid assets or tokens they have in inventory, EDX Clearing is constantly identifying opportunities to responsibly lower the total cost of trading. EDX Clearing prioritizes its members’ safety, notably by segregating and protecting the assets our members entrust with us, even in the most extreme scenarios, including bankruptcy. &nbsp;</p>



<p>It may sound simple, but eliminating the need for bilateral transacting doesn’t just reduce counterparty risk – it saves members from the burden of actually creating and executing the bilateral agreements themselves. These agreements require extensive due diligence and significant time and effort from trading, technology and compliance personnel. At scale, they quickly become an operational nightmare. On our venue, members directly face EDX Clearing as the counterparty for every transaction, so they can perform the due diligence process only once and access a full universe of aggregated liquidity on day one.</p>



<p>With all trades settling through EDX Clearing, our clearinghouse also enables qualified members to settle on a net basis. This addresses the risk of members sending and receiving multiple payments each day, but it also dramatically simplifies back-office operations and lowers administrative costs, enabling these often-overworked teams to focus on more important priorities. Scaling non-additive processes is one of the principal challenges of growing a trading business.</p>



<p>By netting transactions and carefully managing risk across EDX Markets, we create an environment where we can extend leverage to qualified members – up to 5x on each deposit. Together, these capabilities enable market development, streamlined operations and volume growth, enabling institutions to trade digital assets with the same scale and sophistication as in traditional markets.</p>



<p><strong>Critical Mass</strong></p>



<p>While our clearinghouse enables meaningful safety and efficiency, this is just the beginning. The benefits will become even more apparent as we continue to onboard members and reinforce our presence in the market.</p>



<p>As more institutions have recognized the value of our model, we have created a large network of liquidity providers and order flow providers. These new entrants to EDX Markets make the liquidity environment more robust. Over time, the benefits of EDX Markets as an ideal environment for market participants to secure optimal execution results will contribute to the evolution of the digital asset space at large.</p>



<p>Building with scale and expertise, we’ll continue to fine-tune these operational and capital efficiencies to meet the high standards of today’s institutional market participants. Our investors support our view that central clearing is integral to market efficiency, and we are committed to working with these firms toward constant evolution and enhancement.</p>



<p>“The structure provided by EDX Clearing enables us to focus on what matters: executing trades and growing our business,” said Gordon Wallace, President &amp; Co-Founder of BlockFills. “By removing the need for bilateral agreements and enabling net settlement, they have greatly reduced both counterparty risk and administrative burdens. This approach is exactly what institutional crypto markets need to reach their full potential.”</p>



<p>Supported by the secure protocols that only a central clearinghouse can provide, EDX Markets is built for trust, liquidity and efficiency at every turn. Our model insulates our clients from risk while delivering the institutional trading experience they require and the efficiencies to help them scale. It’s a powerful offering that we see as nothing less than a reinvention of institutional crypto markets.</p>

<p><em>Venue updates deliver more efficient volume processing and greater trade flexibility</em></p>



<p>EDX Markets, a leading digital asset technology firm that combines an institution-only trading venue with a central clearinghouse, today reported record volumes, unveiled a new matching engine and announced the launch of SHIB and DOGE on its trading platform.</p>



<p>This week, EDX facilitated record high volumes with members trading over $685 million in a 24-hour period. Overall, EDX Markets has experienced strong volume growth of late, with average daily volumes growing 59% in Q3, while industry volume in spot BTC and ETH declined by 14.8% over the same period<sup>1</sup>. EDX has successfully matched over $36 billion in notional volume since January 2024, demonstrating growing liquidity and client demand for its services.</p>



<p>EDX recently launched its proprietary, cutting-edge New Matching Engine (“NME”) with industry-leading performance capabilities. NME, built in-house by a team of engineers with deep experience at some of the world’s most sophisticated exchanges, boasts ultra-low latencies measured in microseconds, maximizing trading efficiency for clients. In October, NME processed over 2 million trades and over 2.6 billion orders, supporting the continued growth of EDX’s volumes.</p>



<p>Tony Acuña-Rohter, Chief Technology Officer of EDX Markets, commented, “NME enhances EDX’s technological capabilities to allow for superior price discovery, driving tighter spreads for clients.”</p>



<p>NME streamlines trading on EDX’s platform through real-time order matching that delivers efficient market pricing to members across a growing list of digital assets including BTC, ETH and LTC, in addition to EDX’s recent listings of SHIB and DOGE. These updates provide members with greater trading flexibility, enabling them to execute more diverse investment strategies on EDX.</p>



<p>Jamil Nazarali, CEO of EDX Markets, said, “With the successful delivery and implementation of our new matching engine, EDX is well on its way to achieving the goals that we set for ourselves when we launched last year. We are continually improving our offerings based on member feedback to accomplish our mission to bring the most competitive, transparent, trusted, and efficient digital asset trading venue to the world.”</p>
