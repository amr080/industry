<p><em>Venue updates deliver more efficient volume processing and greater trade flexibility</em></p>



<p>EDX Markets, a leading digital asset technology firm that combines an institution-only trading venue with a central clearinghouse, today reported record volumes, unveiled a new matching engine and announced the launch of SHIB and DOGE on its trading platform.</p>



<p>This week, EDX facilitated record high volumes with members trading over $685 million in a 24-hour period. Overall, EDX Markets has experienced strong volume growth of late, with average daily volumes growing 59% in Q3, while industry volume in spot BTC and ETH declined by 14.8% over the same period<sup>1</sup>. EDX has successfully matched over $36 billion in notional volume since January 2024, demonstrating growing liquidity and client demand for its services.</p>



<p>EDX recently launched its proprietary, cutting-edge New Matching Engine (“NME”) with industry-leading performance capabilities. NME, built in-house by a team of engineers with deep experience at some of the world’s most sophisticated exchanges, boasts ultra-low latencies measured in microseconds, maximizing trading efficiency for clients. In October, NME processed over 2 million trades and over 2.6 billion orders, supporting the continued growth of EDX’s volumes.</p>



<p>Tony Acuña-Rohter, Chief Technology Officer of EDX Markets, commented, “NME enhances EDX’s technological capabilities to allow for superior price discovery, driving tighter spreads for clients.”</p>



<p>NME streamlines trading on EDX’s platform through real-time order matching that delivers efficient market pricing to members across a growing list of digital assets including BTC, ETH and LTC, in addition to EDX’s recent listings of SHIB and DOGE. These updates provide members with greater trading flexibility, enabling them to execute more diverse investment strategies on EDX.</p>



<p>Jamil Nazarali, CEO of EDX Markets, said, “With the successful delivery and implementation of our new matching engine, EDX is well on its way to achieving the goals that we set for ourselves when we launched last year. We are continually improving our offerings based on member feedback to accomplish our mission to bring the most competitive, transparent, trusted, and efficient digital asset trading venue to the world.”</p>

<p>Adaptive, the experts in custom trading technology solutions, today announced it partnered with EDX Markets, a digital assets technology firm, to develop and deliver EDX Clearing (EDXC), EDX’s proprietary, cloud-native central clearinghouse.</p>



<p>EDXC is an end-to-end clearinghouse for EDX’s institutional crypto marketplace. Adaptive worked closely with EDX to design and build its unique clearinghouse system to support all-to-all trading on EDX’s marketplace while reducing settlement risk exposure and providing a superior trading experience. EDXC helps to reduce transaction costs and risk for members by netting all trades and operating a once-a-day settlement cycle rather than settling multiple times throughout the trading day with multiple counterparties.</p>



<p>In less than five months, Adaptive and EDX utilized their comprehensive digital asset domain expertise to build the new clearinghouse on Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) cloud, including UX/UI design, end-to-end development, delivery management and SRE.

<p>EDXM Global today announced the forthcoming launch of its perpetual futures venue. EDXM Global is a part of EDX, a family of digital asset technology companies that delivers trusted, liquid and efficient crypto market structures. Expected to go live in Q1 2025, this new venue follows the company’s <a href="https://url.avanan.click/v2/___https:/www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240507178717/en/EDX-Markets-Launches-Singapore-Based-EDXM-Global___.YXAzOmZvcmVmcm9udDphOm86ODE4NjczMzk3MGRkYjgxZDQ1NGVkOTE3N2Q2MzhjYmQ6Njo4NDBjOmM3MzkxYjlhMDE2ODdkNDA4NDhiMWI3ZGU3YjIxZTFmNDI1ZWJjMjBmOWU4OGMwYzhkODFiYmFiNmNhNzk5NmY6cDpGOk4">launch of its Singapore-based settlement service in May 2024</a> and will enable secure, efficient and low-risk trading for perpetual futures contracts in Bitcoin and Ether. Additional major cryptocurrencies, such as Solana and XRP, will be listed in the months following launch.</p>



<p>EDXM Global’s new perpetual futures venue is located in Tokyo at Equinix’s TY3 &nbsp;data center and fortified by a central clearinghouse and single net settlement process, which reduces the upfront capital required to trade and minimizes credit risk. The venue also has a unique bankruptcy-remote structure that enables members to retain ownership of their currency deposits. Accessible via GUI or API, the venue will begin client onboarding this month. More information can be found at <a href="https://url.avanan.click/v2/___http:/www.edxmarkets.com/edxmglobal___.YXAzOmZvcmVmcm9udDphOm86ODE4NjczMzk3MGRkYjgxZDQ1NGVkOTE3N2Q2MzhjYmQ6NjoyNGQ2OmRjMTUwYjQ0YzM2NzhmNjQ2NmIwMzhmZTIwNjRmZTRiOWQ1NmI0NGI0ODliOTcxYjliMDNiNDliOWNlZDJlNjE6cDpGOk4">www.edxmarkets.com/edxmglobal</a>.</p>



<p>The new venue will launch under the leadership of EDXM Global’s new CEO, Kai Kono, who has held leadership roles at institutional digital asset firms, including Zodia Custody, since 2018. Kono also brings over 10 years of experience from traditional financial firms such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers.</p>



<p>Kono is joined by Chief Compliance Officer Rakesh Madamanchi, who was previously Head of Compliance at Blockchain.com. Madamanchi’s background includes over 15 years of legal and compliance experience at global banks including Wells Fargo, ANZ and Standard Chartered Bank. Kono and Madamanchi are based in EDXM Global’s Singapore headquarters.</p>



<p>Jamil Nazarali, CEO of EDX, said, “EDXM Global’s perpetual futures venue will provide clients with a safer, more streamlined experience that reduces costs and improves both capital and operational efficiency. We’re excited to launch this new business and have complete confidence in its success under Kai’s leadership.”</p>



<p>Kono commented, “I am thrilled to lead EDXM Global’s growth in APAC and to help accelerate the adoption of digital asset strategies for institutions in the region. Many of these firms have long had the desire to enter this space, but have been reluctant to do so given the perceived risks. Now that EDXM Global can deliver crypto derivatives trading within a familiar, secure trading environment, I anticipate strong interest from a wide range of participants.”</p>

<li><em>EDX closed series B funding round co-led by Pantera Capital and Sequoia Capital to fuel international expansion.</em></li>



<li><em>Launched new clearinghouse to provide members with the most competitive and capital efficient market through a streamlined settlement process.</em></li>



<li><em>Members traded more than $1.4 billion in notional volume in December ‘23 and Clearinghouse has cleared more than $3.1 billion of transactions since launch in October.</em></li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<p>EDX Markets (EDX), a leading digital asset marketplace designed to meet the needs of both crypto-native firms and the world&#8217;s largest financial institutions, today announced the successful launch of its digital asset clearinghouse, EDX Clearing, and the completion of its Series B investment round, with new investor Pantera Capital co-leading with founding investor Sequoia Capital.</p>



<p>“Further, Pantera’s investment in EDX demonstrates the success of our model and ability to attract quality investors to EDX. We are thrilled to have Pantera back EDX on our mission to be the most competitive, transparent, trusted, and efficient digital asset market.&#8221;</p>



<p>EDX Clearing (EDXC) revolutionizes EDX’s marketplace and is the newest advancement in the markets for digital assets. With the launch of EDXC, members benefit from a competitive non-custodial market without the need for bilateral trading agreements. All trades matched on EDX’s market settle through EDXC in a single net settlement process, increasing operational efficiency and reducing the upfront capital required to trade. EDXC significantly reduces credit risk for its members by functioning as a central counterparty.</p>



<p>The launch of EDX Clearing comes as the company closed its Series B funding round that welcomed Pantera Capital as an equity investor, and included original founding consortium members Citadel Securities, Fidelity Digital Assets<sup>SM</sup>, Virtu Financial, and Sequoia Capital. Other investors in EDX include Charles Schwab, DV Crypto, GSR Markets LTD, GTS, HRT Technology, Miami International Holdings and Paradigm. The new funding will support EDX as it continues to develop its technology and will fund EDX’s global expansion.</p>



<p>“EDX Clearing is a major differentiator for EDX as it streamlines settlement while reducing counterparty risk and capital requirements for our members. Clearing has already delivered significant value to our members who have traded $3.1 billion in notional since its launch. We expect the impact to increase moving forward, positioning us to capitalize on this new wave of institutional growth accelerated by the recent approval of spot BTC ETFs in the U.S,” said Jamil Nazarali, CEO of EDX. “Further, Pantera’s investment in EDX demonstrates the success of our model and ability to attract quality investors to EDX. We are thrilled to have Pantera back EDX on our mission to be the most competitive, transparent, trusted, and efficient digital asset market.”</p>



<p>&#8220;Institutional crypto investors care more than ever about counterparty risk management,&#8221; said Paul Veradittakit, managing partner at Pantera Capital. &#8220;Globally we&#8217;re seeing institutions gravitate towards non-custodial marketplaces. With its capitally efficient product, best in class risk management, and backing from global financial heavyweights, EDX is primed to usher in a new era of institutional crypto trading. There is no better team to serve institutional clients, so we know the future of institutional crypto trading is in great hands with Jamil and his team at EDX.”</p>
