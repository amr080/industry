<p>Wall Street veteran Jamil Nazarali, the founder and current CEO of the exchange, will move to the position of executive chairman of the board, according to a&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://edxmarkets.com/edx-appoints-jamil-nazarali-executive-chair-tony-acuna-rohter-to-serve-as-ceo/" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a>.</p>



<p>Acuña-Rohter previously served as the chief technology officer of the firm since joining in 2022. Before EDX, he was the CTO of ErisX, a crypto firm acquired by Cboe in late 2021 that led to the start of Cboe Digital, the crypto arm of Cboe.</p>



<p>“I am proud to have led EDX through its initial start-up phase and to have built such a strong team of leaders and operators across the firm,” said Jamil Nazarali, Executive Chair, EDX. “EDX promptly reached significant volumes and has seen a growing client base and strong institutional and retail flows since launch. Now is the right time to transition operational responsibilities to a new generation of leaders.”</p>

<p>EDX Markets, an institutional crypto trading venue with a central clearinghouse, had record volumes on its US spot crypto market as it prepares to launch a perpetual futures venue in Singapore.</p>



<p>Jamil Nazarali, chief executive of EDX Markets, told Markets Media that the growth in spot volumes has outstripped the increase in  market volumes. “Since the end of the third quarter and the US election we have seen incredible growth and there is strong sentiment in the market about the future regulatory environment,” he added.</p>



<p>EDX provides separate quotes&nbsp;&nbsp;for institutions and retail intermediaries and&nbsp;said it has traded and cleared $39.8bn of member volume since the start of this year. In November EDX said it facilitated record volume with members trading over $685m in a 24-hour period. Volume in the month-to-date has reached $5.8bn.</p>

<li>In an exclusive interview, CEO Jamil Nazarali says the crypto exchange plans to offer Bitcoin derivatives.</li>



<li>CEO says Wall Street-backed exchange plans to offer perpetual futures.</li>



<li>The move means EDX will compete with BitMEX and OKX.</li>
</ul>



<p>In a move to capture more institutional investors, EDX Markets, the new crypto exchange backed by Wall Street giants, is planning to establish a “substantial footprint” in Singapore this year, CEO Jamil Nazarali told&nbsp;<em>DL News&nbsp;</em>in an interview this week.</p>



<p>The exchange, which is backed by Fidelity Digital Assets, Citadel Securities, and Charles Schwab, also plans on pushing into the crypto derivatives market.</p>



<p>Derivatives such as Bitcoin and Ethereum futures contracts account for almost&nbsp;<a href="https://ccdata.io/reports/exchange-review-march-2023">three-quarters</a>&nbsp;of the total crypto market, according to CCData. With the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/sec-approves-spot-bitcoin-etfs-in-flurry-of-confusion/#:~:text=SEC%20approves%20Bitcoin%20ETFs%20for,dawns%20for%20crypto%20%E2%80%93%20DL%20News">approval</a>&nbsp;of spot price Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the US in January, derivatives trading volume surged more than 35%.</p>



<p>Yet Nazarali said it’s difficult to play in that marketplace from a US base.</p>



<p>“If we move outside of the US, the list of tokens that we can trade is much larger because of the greater regulatory clarity outside of the US,” he added. “We do think that the size of the opportunity is much larger outside of the US than it is inside the US.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Perpetuals</strong></h4>



<p>To be sure, crypto derivatives are a robust market in the US. CME Group, which introduced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin/bitcoin.volume.html">Bitcoin futures contracts</a>&nbsp;in 2017, executes about $4 billion a day in trades.</p>



<p>Nazarali said a Singapore-based exchange will open the door for offering perpetual futures, a popular derivative form of crypto assets that typically uses leverage to maximise returns.</p>



<p>The contracts allow investors to bet on the future prices of Bitcoin and other assets and automatically rollover their investments when their terms expire.</p>



<p>“That’s something we can’t do in the US,” Nazarali said.</p>



<p>BitMEX and OKX, both of which operate out of Asia, have built major franchises in the crypto derivatives space, and Binance plays there, too. They will become EDX’s new competitors.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Regulatory approval</strong></h4>



<p>Nazarali praised Singapore’s strong regulatory framework, its position as a global financial capital, and supply of talent.</p>



<p>EDX plans to receive full regulatory approval from the Monetary Authority of Singapore within the next 18 to 24 months.</p>



<p>“One of the things that [clients are] particularly interested in is for us to launch an international exchange so that they are able to do some of their trading that they can’t do on our US marketplace,” he said.</p>



<p>In the US, EDX currently offers only three different coins for trading: Bitcoin, Ether and Litecoin. The list is narrow, Nazarali said, due to “a lot of <a href="https://www.dlnews.com/articles/regulation/the-consumer-financial-protection-bureau-draws-fire-from-coinbase/">regulatory uncertainty</a> in the US over which cryptocurrencies are securities and which are not.”</p>

<p>EDX Markets, the crypto-trading venue backed by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/9869818Z:US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Citadel Securities</a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/2286296D:LN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fidelity Digital Assets</a>, is building an exchange in Singapore and expanding to offer spot and perpetual futures after securing additional financing from investors.</p>



<p>The company completed a second funding round co-led by new investor&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/0222273D:US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pantera Capital</a>&nbsp;and existing backer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/18308Z:US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sequoia Capital</a>, according to Chief Executive Officer&nbsp;Jamil Nazarali. The capital will be used to build new technology and expand EDX’s presence in new markets abroad, he said, declining to disclose the exact size of the Series B funding.</p>



<p>“Singapore will allow us to expand our products, where we will be able to trade more tokens and perpetual futures,” Nazarali said in an interview. “It’s also a great place to hire financial talent, and we want to build a proper, trusted team.”</p>



<p>The plans come just as the cryptocurrency market is heating up again, with increased enthusiasm from traditional finance titans thanks to the recent approval of exchange-traded funds investing directly in Bitcoin. While EDX isn’t providing crypto custody, the firm gives institutional investors a platform to buy and sell tokens including Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin directly, hedging their exposure to ETF products.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Leveraging limitations</h4>



<p>Earlier this summer, EDX Markets made waves when it launched in the United States, making it the closest thing to a bank-backed exchange state-side. Backed by financial heavyweights such as Charles Schwab, Citadel Securities and Fidelity Digital Assets, it looked to bridge the gap between financial institutions and digital asset natives.</p>



<p>Despite the mounting regulatory scrutiny from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the past year, the emergence of EDX Markets served as a bright spot amid all the enforcement actions that have taken place in the past year.</p>



<p><strong>See also:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/20/new-crypto-exchange-backed-by-fidelity-schwab-and-citadel-launches/"><strong>Crypto Exchange Backed by Fidelity, Schwab and Citadel Launches</strong></a></p>



<p>But until the dynamic shifts such that these bank-backed venues are in a position to accept retail players, my hunch is that the market will stay as is. These developments are less about operational choices and more to do with overcoming regulatory roadblocks.</p>



<p>Now, more than ever before, safety and trust are integral to crypto. However, purely leaning on the reputation of the traditional banking industry shouldn’t be the only solution. Blockchain is inherently the right technology to build a financial system that is less reliant on the morality and management of individuals, and we’re slowly seeing its benefits reemerge as the dust settles after a tumultuous year of industry scrutiny.</p>



<p>Exchanges built for crypto-native investors still have the edge over the latecomers. And if we’re all after a similar slice of the pie, the banks will need to get in line.</p>

<p>In this segment of TabbFORUM at STA, Jeanine Hightower-Sellitto, Chief Commercial &amp; Strategy Officer at EDX Markets, provides an overview of the institutional crypto market, saying that some firms are still in the planning stage and evaluating who to best partner with, from custodians to exchanges, while others are more advanced and looking at liquidity-related issues. In this interview, conducted by TABB Group CEO Bruce Morris, Ms. Hightower-Sellitto explains the role of EDX Markets in crypto and how it was designed to mirror how a traditional, rules-based exchange operates. Ms. Hightower-Sellitto spoke with TabbFORUM at the Security Traders Association&#8217;s 90th Market Structure Conference held in Washington, D.C. from October 11-13.</p>
