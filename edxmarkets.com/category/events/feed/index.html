<p>The Hedgeweek APAC Digital Assets Summit 2024, held on December 4 in Singapore, gathered thought leaders and innovators to explore the rapidly evolving landscape of institutional digital assets. EDXM Global CEO Kai Kono and Head of Institutions Kal Chan proudly represented EDXMG at the event, hosting a roundtable on the topic of “Institutional Adoption in the Digital Assets Market.”</p>



<p>Kai and Kal led an insightful conversation addressing the catalysts enabling more widespread acceptance among traditional finance players and the critical role of infrastructure and service providers in supporting institutions with reliable, secure and scalable solutions.</p>



<p>Key takeaways from the panel included:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Institutional Adoption is Accelerating: </strong>Family offices, asset managers and financial firms are integrating cryptocurrencies into their portfolios, driven by increasing regulatory clarity, innovative product offerings and advances in blockchain technology.<br></li>



<li><strong>Regulatory Shifts are Catalyzing Growth: </strong>The appointment of crypto-friendly regulators and pro-crypto political leadership in the U.S. is fostering an accommodating environment for institutional growth globally. This trend signals optimism for more robust international participation in the digital asset market.<br></li>



<li><strong>Tokenization is Unlocking New Value Streams: </strong>Tokenization – or converting traditional assets into digital tokens on blockchain platforms – is being explored by institutions as an avenue to increase liquidity and capital efficiency.<br></li>



<li><strong>ETFs are Opening the Door to Crypto: </strong>The launch of Bitcoin ETFs and other crypto-related investment products is simplifying institutional access to digital assets. ETFs have become the most common entry point for asset managers and family offices to allocate digital assets into their portfolios. From here, firms often expand into options, futures and structured products to hedge overall exposure and increase risk-adjusted returns.<br></li>



<li><strong>The Future is Bright (But Not Without Challenges): </strong>The convergence of traditional finance and digital assets suggests a transformative period ahead. We can expect to see enhanced stability for major cryptocurrencies, broader adoption of tokenized assets and a more integrated global financial system down the road. Nevertheless, concerns around regulatory compliance, security and market volatility remain critical considerations for sustained growth in the sector.</li>
</ul>



<p>For EDXM Global, participating in events like the Hedgeweek APAC Digital Assets Summit is essential to fulfilling our mission of building institutional-grade infrastructure for digital assets. By driving conversations around innovation and adoption, we remain committed to bridging the gap between TradFi and the financial industry’s digital future</p>

<p>The Dallas Security Traders Association (DSTA)’s 2024 Texas Traders Convention took place from Oct 17 &#8211; &nbsp;Oct 19 at the Ritz-Carlton Dallas. The event featured an informative line up of panels and roundtables covering ETFs, listed options, regulatory trends, the upcoming presidential election and more.</p>



<p>EDX Markets Chief Commercial and Strategy Officer, Jeanine Hightower-Sellitto spoke on the panel <em>“Future of Markets: Navigating Market Innovation, Crypto Trends, and Regulatory Waves”</em> on Thursday, Oct 17. She was joined by several panelists from the exchange community, including Dream Exchange CEO Joseph Cecala and NYSE Head of Business Development and Strategic Partnerships / Senior Director at ICE Jim Hyde. Other panelists included Grayscale VP of ETF Capital Markets Krista Lynch and S3 Co-Founder and CEO Mark Davies, who contributed their own distinct perspectives to the conversation.</p>



<p>Set against the dynamic backdrop of Dallas – a rapidly growing hub of financial innovation – the panel fostered a vibrant discussion on market evolution. With major financial institutions establishing roots and the launch of the highly anticipated TXSE on the horizon, Dallas continues to strengthen its position as a financial powerhouse.</p>



<p>This year’s Texas Traders Convention provided the EDX team with an invaluable opportunity to connect with the broader financial markets community. It allowed us to share our mission of merging best practices from the world of TradFi with the cutting-edge modernity of the crypto space, demonstrating how our venue is shaping the future of digital assets &nbsp;infrastructure and the capital markets as a whole.</p>
