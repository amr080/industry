<p>The 3rd annual <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/boston-institutional-digital-assets-forum-2024-tickets-949448615367">Boston Institutional Digital Assets Forum</a> took place on December 3 at the iconic Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Industry leaders, regulatory experts and financial innovators gathered to discuss the pressing issues and transformative strategies shaping the institutional digital asset ecosystem. EDX was a proud platinum sponsor of this year’s event.</p>



<p>EDX Chief Commercial and Strategy Officer Jeanine Hightower-Sellitto moderated the panel “<em>Building Institutional Grade Digital Assets Infrastructure.</em>” The discussion featured a lineup of industry leaders from Cohen &amp; Company, Axon Trade, AlphaPoint and Blockfills, who delved into the emerging standards and practices essential for constructing scalable, robust and secure infrastructure to support institutional adoption of digital assets.</p>



<p>Given the city’s rich financial history, Boston was an appropriate setting to underscore the conversation on the rapidly evolving digital asset space. Key takeaways from the panel included:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Institutional-grade infrastructure for digital assets is now on the verge of mainstream adoption. <strong>Asset managers, RIAs, wealth advisors</strong> and other institutional players are increasingly integrating these technologies into their portfolios.</li>



<li>The industry is rapidly evolving to support key features already commonplace in traditional asset classes, such as <strong>colocation, FIX connectivity</strong> and <strong>central clearing</strong> through innovations like EDX’s central clearinghouse.</li>



<li>Institutional adoption of crypto is driving advancements in <strong>brokerage, lending</strong> and <strong>custody solutions</strong>. These developments aim to integrate seamlessly with both existing legacy systems and the emerging digital asset ecosystem.</li>



<li>Institutions are <strong>actively preparing policies and procedures</strong> to not only engage with existing crypto assets, but also to accommodate the <strong>next wave of tokenized real-world assets </strong>— a development poised to redefine asset ownership and liquidity.</li>
</ul>



<p>For EDX, this event was more than just an opportunity to connect with peers: it was a platform to champion our mission to bring trusted, liquid and efficient venues to the crypto space. By emphasizing institutional-grade reliability, scalability and compliance, EDX is at the forefront of shaping the future of digital asset infrastructure.</p>



<p>We’re excited about what’s to come and look forward to attending future events. Thanks to all who attended!</p>

<p><em>By Jamil Nazarali, CEO and John Fennell, Chief Risk Officer &amp; Head of Clearing Operations</em></p>



<p>When we speak with prospective <a href="https://url.avanan.click/v2/___https:/edxmarkets.com/edx-markets/___.YXAzOmZvcmVmcm9udDphOm86MzgzZjRlMWMwYjUxOTdkNzNmYTIxYWQ2MzliMDUxZWI6NjoxM2FmOmJkYTZiODEyOTY0MjBjMTNiN2VkODU5MThmODQyNjUxMTEwYmZkYjdmMDAwOWQ2MmU5NDMyODFjMTdhODVmNmY6cDpUOk4">EDX Markets</a> participants, one of the first things we ask is what they’re looking for in a trading venue. The answers vary, but they often boil down to one key factor: efficiency.</p>



<p>These financial institutions tend to value forward thinking, so they are willing to embrace innovative structures that enhance their digital asset trading experience. Almost invariably, they are looking to reach more counterparties, trade at higher volumes and secure better executions. At the same time, they value the responsible, trusted structures from traditional markets that enable them to operate at scale.</p>



<p>It’s fitting, then, that one of EDX Markets’ biggest drivers of value, delivering safety, security and efficiency, is our central clearinghouse.</p>



<p><strong>From Security to Efficiency</strong></p>



<p>Today, EDX Markets is the world’s only centrally cleared crypto trading venue. Integral to how our institution-only marketplace functions, EDX Clearing unlocks unique operational and capital efficiencies for our trading members.</p>



<p>In our conversations, financial institutions have an immediate positive response to our clearinghouse. As principal to each trade, EDX Clearing greatly reduces counterparty exposure risk by ensuring timely and certain settlements each day, drawing from its committed default fund if necessary. Our risk management processes are inspired by best practices from the world’s most sophisticated exchanges and institutional trading firms. Beyond these concrete benefits, our central clearinghouse represents a commitment to stability and responsibility, giving our members peace of mind that we offer a safe environment for trading.</p>



<p>What isn’t always immediately understood is the power of our clearinghouse to drive efficiency. Our mission is to operate the most trusted, liquid and efficient crypto trading venues available, and our clearinghouse is integral to all three pillars. Whether in the form of delivering flexible settlement processes or enabling members to collateralize trades with liquid assets or tokens they have in inventory, EDX Clearing is constantly identifying opportunities to responsibly lower the total cost of trading. EDX Clearing prioritizes its members’ safety, notably by segregating and protecting the assets our members entrust with us, even in the most extreme scenarios, including bankruptcy. &nbsp;</p>



<p>It may sound simple, but eliminating the need for bilateral transacting doesn’t just reduce counterparty risk – it saves members from the burden of actually creating and executing the bilateral agreements themselves. These agreements require extensive due diligence and significant time and effort from trading, technology and compliance personnel. At scale, they quickly become an operational nightmare. On our venue, members directly face EDX Clearing as the counterparty for every transaction, so they can perform the due diligence process only once and access a full universe of aggregated liquidity on day one.</p>



<p>With all trades settling through EDX Clearing, our clearinghouse also enables qualified members to settle on a net basis. This addresses the risk of members sending and receiving multiple payments each day, but it also dramatically simplifies back-office operations and lowers administrative costs, enabling these often-overworked teams to focus on more important priorities. Scaling non-additive processes is one of the principal challenges of growing a trading business.</p>



<p>By netting transactions and carefully managing risk across EDX Markets, we create an environment where we can extend leverage to qualified members – up to 5x on each deposit. Together, these capabilities enable market development, streamlined operations and volume growth, enabling institutions to trade digital assets with the same scale and sophistication as in traditional markets.</p>



<p><strong>Critical Mass</strong></p>



<p>While our clearinghouse enables meaningful safety and efficiency, this is just the beginning. The benefits will become even more apparent as we continue to onboard members and reinforce our presence in the market.</p>



<p>As more institutions have recognized the value of our model, we have created a large network of liquidity providers and order flow providers. These new entrants to EDX Markets make the liquidity environment more robust. Over time, the benefits of EDX Markets as an ideal environment for market participants to secure optimal execution results will contribute to the evolution of the digital asset space at large.</p>



<p>Building with scale and expertise, we’ll continue to fine-tune these operational and capital efficiencies to meet the high standards of today’s institutional market participants. Our investors support our view that central clearing is integral to market efficiency, and we are committed to working with these firms toward constant evolution and enhancement.</p>



<p>“The structure provided by EDX Clearing enables us to focus on what matters: executing trades and growing our business,” said Gordon Wallace, President &amp; Co-Founder of BlockFills. “By removing the need for bilateral agreements and enabling net settlement, they have greatly reduced both counterparty risk and administrative burdens. This approach is exactly what institutional crypto markets need to reach their full potential.”</p>



<p>Supported by the secure protocols that only a central clearinghouse can provide, EDX Markets is built for trust, liquidity and efficiency at every turn. Our model insulates our clients from risk while delivering the institutional trading experience they require and the efficiencies to help them scale. It’s a powerful offering that we see as nothing less than a reinvention of institutional crypto markets.</p>

<p>At EDX, we’ve always prioritized meeting our clients where they’re at. For us, that means building trusted, liquid and efficient venues that enable institutions and retail intermediaries to trade crypto with confidence.</p>



<p>We first entered the scene in 2022, supported by the backing of some of the world’s most prominent trading and venture capital firms<a>.</a> Our investors believed in our clear, singular mission: to provide destinations for crypto trading that emulate the industry’s most sophisticated exchanges.  With their guidance and insight, we have made tremendous progress in satisfying the growing number of institutions adopting digital assets.</p>



<p>In the two years since our launch, that trend has only continued. We’ve risen to the occasion to meet the demand, powering access to these markets via an institutional trading experience. Leveraging best practices from traditional finance – ultra-low-latency technology, 24/7 human support and operational and capital efficiencies supported by a central clearinghouse – we operate venues that meet the needs of crypto natives and new entrants alike.</p>



<p>Today, the momentum continues: we’re thrilled to announce the launch of our updated brand and new website. As our business grows alongside the crypto space, we’re proud to upgrade our public presence, with a look and feel that is as sleek and sophisticated as the trading venues we’ve built.</p>



<p>The new website is the ideal showcase for our business, with dynamic visuals that evoke liquidity and efficiency. It breaks down the benefits of our clearinghouse model, highlighting the myriad ways it enables speed and flexibility while minimizing risk. Our new site underlines the attributes that have made our spot venue, <a href="https://edxmarkets.com/">EDX Markets</a>, an attractive choice for a diverse range of institutions: deep liquidity, firm prices, low-cost transacting and an array of supporting capabilities to help them execute at optimal prices.</p>



<p>This refresh is just the latest milestone during what has been a truly exciting time for EDX. Earlier this year, we unveiled our upgraded ultra-low-latency matching engine, and just last week, the CEO of our Singapore-based sister company, EDX Global, announced the &nbsp;forthcoming launch their perpetual futures venue that will further extend our capabilities and reach to serve institutions trading crypto across the globe*. Beyond that, we are seeing sustained growth and momentum, with our backers continuing to lend their vital support. In the coming months, we plan to add new coins and products to our venues and make other platform enhancements, building on the strong foundation we’ve laid.</p>



<p>We believe we have a unique opportunity to set the precedent for centrally cleared trading venues in the digital asset space – and we don’t take that responsibility lightly. We will remain ever-vigilant in our efforts to usher in a new era where institutional participation in crypto is the norm, and where leading institutions have access to deep liquidity, transparent markets and cutting-edge technology as never before.</p>



<p>As this industry continues to mature and expand, we eye the road ahead with excitement. We invite you to explore our revamped website and stay tuned into our social media channels for more updates. In the meantime, we’ll continue our work to bring familiar standards of competition, transparency and safety to the wider world of crypto.</p>



<p>* EDXM Global’s products and services are only available to non-US persons and non-US institutions in select jurisdictions. US persons and institutions are strictly prohibited from access.<a id="_msocom_1"></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today is one of the most exciting days of my career. After many months of planning, the news is finally out: EDXM Global will launch its perpetual futures venue in Q1 2025 . This represents a major milestone for all members of the institutional crypto community, from digital asset natives to more traditional entities seeking to enter the market for the first time.</p>



<p>Like our <a href="https://edxmarkets.com/edx-markets-launches-singapore-based-edxm-global/">settlement service that launched in May</a>, EDXM Global’s perpetual futures venue will be based in Singapore.  Members will be able to trade perpetual futures contracts in Bitcoin, Ether and certain high-market-cap altcoins in a highly sophisticated manner under a bankruptcy-remote account structure.  This means customer assets are always protected because we keep them apart from our business, separating custody of client collateral under a trust structure. It’s an exciting new venture for us – but EDX’s core commitment to operating trusted, liquid and efficient digital asset trading venues remains unchanged.</p>



<p><a href="https://edxmarkets.com/edxm-global/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Our perpetual futures business</a> will showcase that commitment in a number of ways. We’ve made it as easy as possible for members to start trading, with a rapid onboarding process, ready access to liquidity and a dynamic, intuitive dashboard for execution, operations and risk management. We also feature a low-latency proprietary matching engine, based in Equinix’s TY3 data center, means they can capitalize on market opportunities without delay.</p>



<p>One of the main reasons we decided to apply for our spot exchange business in Singapore is because of the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s (MAS) status as a thoughtful and highly  esteemed regulator on the world stage in digital assets.  We believe MAS has been intentional about taking a progressive stance on crypto, supporting innovation while simultaneously putting down clear guardrails to foster investor protection and market stability.</p>



<p>With that in mind, we’re moving quickly to expand our presence. We are in the process of applying to launch a Singapore-based spot business, which will formally establish our clearing entity and provide institutions with an even broader array of options for pursuing their crypto investing goals. At the same time, we are actively working to enhance our initial perpetual futures marketplace and settlement service with modern capabilities that will empower members to transact with as few limits as possible. Our deep engagement with the local crypto community, combined with close consultation with our investors and advisors, gives us the confidence that we are on the right track toward transforming the market for crypto.</p>



<p>Today’s announcement represents a significant milestone – not just for EDX and the Singapore crypto community, but for me personally. I’ve been in crypto for over six years, and the evolution we’ve seen in that time has been truly eye-opening. Yes, we’ve all witnessed the turmoil that can occur with the rise of a new asset class – but the space has evolved and is now stronger than ever, defined by a renewed commitment to protecting client assets and building for the long-term future of crypto. The chance to be part of this commitment with such an impactful new offering is the culmination of my career in this space.</p>



<p>So, stay tuned as we work to make good on the goals I outlined earlier in this article. If you trade in Singapore and are seeking a way to access the crypto futures market, reach a wider network of counterparties or increase your trading efficiency, EDXM Global could be the ideal venue for you. I encourage you to contact us today.</p>



<p><em><strong>Disclaimer: Perpetual futures trading is currently not regulated by MAS and hence is offered by a subsidiary separate from EDXM Global Pte. Ltd. Notwithstanding, EDXM Global upholds the highest standards of regulatory compliance and corporate governance across all its activities.</strong></em></p>



<p><em><strong>Disclaimer: EDXM Global’s products and services are only available to non-US persons and non-US institutions in select jurisdictions. US persons and institutions are strictly prohibited from access.</strong></em></p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading">THE FUTURE OF INSTITUTIONAL TRADING</h4>



<p>The gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance has become increasingly evident as crypto has matured. Institutional investors are accustomed to the regulated and sophisticated mechanisms of TradFi products and struggle to navigate the complexities of crypto platforms. Current crypto trading solutions, while innovative, often fall short in addressing the nuanced needs of institutional players. Fragmented liquidity, heightened counterparty risks, and the lack of a low-cost, capital-efficient trading environment are major hurdles for institutions to overcome. We believe seamless integration of institutional capital into the crypto markets is integral to the next evolution of the industry.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">ENTER EDX MARKETS</h4>



<p>EDX Markets represents a seismic shift in the crypto trading landscape, particularly for institutional players. At Pantera, we have always been keen on backing ventures that we believe not only promise innovation but also demonstrate a clear understanding of market needs and future trends. EDX Markets, with its crypto exchange and clearinghouse built on tested TradFi best practices, aligns with our vision of a more mature and accessible crypto market for institutional investors.</p>



<p>We believe EDX Markets sets itself apart from other exchanges with its non-custodial model, robust clearinghouse operations, and liquidity provision from leading TradFi institutions. Segregating the exchange from custody function removes a layer of counterparty risk for institutions, while offering a level of flexibility unmatched by other marketplaces. Via its clearinghouse, EDX also significantly reduces the amount of capital institutions need for trading and daily settlement. Finally, with global leaders in liquidity provision like Citadel Securities and Virtu Financial backing the exchange, we believe EDX is poised to become one of the most liquid crypto venues in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The EDX team blends technological expertise with deep market understanding, led by CEO Jamil Nazarali. Armed with decades of experience in traditional market making, most recently as Global Head of Business Development at Citadel Securities, We believe Jamil is the ideal leader to introduce TradFi market principles to crypto. His vision is supported by a team with decades of experience across a range of TradFi, tech, and crypto companies, including Fidelity Digital Assets, CBOE Digital, ISE, the OCC, Coinbase and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re excited to co-lead the Series B round for EDX Markets alongside Sequoia Capital, and join other strategic partners like Citadel Securities, Virtu Financial, Fidelity Digital Assets, and Charles Schwab on the board. We believe in EDX’s potential to redefine institutional crypto trading and are excited to support their journey towards integrating institutional capital into the crypto market.</p>
