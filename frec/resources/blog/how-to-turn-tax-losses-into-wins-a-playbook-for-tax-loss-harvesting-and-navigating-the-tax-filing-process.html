<p>With Frec Direct Indexing, you can expect to tax loss harvest up to 45% of your portfolio over 10 years, or 14.7% in the first year.<sup data-fn="b56f786b-9bfb-43c8-bbdb-61a75d2e9a69" class="fn"><a href="how-to-turn-tax-losses-into-wins-a-playbook-for-tax-loss-harvesting-and-navigating-the-tax-filing-process.html#b56f786b-9bfb-43c8-bbdb-61a75d2e9a69" id="b56f786b-9bfb-43c8-bbdb-61a75d2e9a69-link">1</a></sup> </p>



<p>14.7% sounds great, but what does that actually mean for you?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ll break it down for you using an average 33.3%<sup data-fn="a58ff1e4-a9a6-4cb8-a143-211a20c795c9" class="fn"><a href="how-to-turn-tax-losses-into-wins-a-playbook-for-tax-loss-harvesting-and-navigating-the-tax-filing-process.html#a58ff1e4-a9a6-4cb8-a143-211a20c795c9" id="a58ff1e4-a9a6-4cb8-a143-211a20c795c9-link">2</a></sup> tax rate and a one-time $50,000 investment. Assuming 14.7% of your portfolio was tax loss harvested in the first year, that is a total of $7,200. However, that doesn’t mean you receive $7,200 back in your pocket. It means you can apply that number as a loss line item on your tax form. As such, you can use that loss for one of two things:&nbsp;</p>



<p>1. Reduce your capital gains&nbsp;<br>2. Deduct from other kinds of income, like your salary or interest income</p>



<p>Let’s break down each of the above situations:&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Reducing your short &amp; long-term capital gain taxes</h2>



<p><em>What are long term &amp; short term capital losses and gains?</em></p>



<p>It’s first important to explain that a capital gain will occur when you sell stock you own at a price that is higher than what you paid for it and a loss will occur when you sell stock you own at a price lower than what you paid for it. Then you can separate these two categories even further into short term and long term. If you hold a stock for longer than a year prior to selling it, it’s considered a long-term capital gain or loss and if it’s less than a year it’s short-term. <br><br>The reason it’s important to know whether your gains are short-term or long-term is because the IRS taxes them differently. Your short term gains will be taxed as ordinary income, while long-term gains are taxed at the capital-gains tax rate. Capital-gains tax rate can be significantly lower than ordinary income tax. It’s currently 15%<sup data-fn="47ec869f-4e8f-40c4-8388-892ae476230b" class="fn"><a href="how-to-turn-tax-losses-into-wins-a-playbook-for-tax-loss-harvesting-and-navigating-the-tax-filing-process.html#47ec869f-4e8f-40c4-8388-892ae476230b" id="47ec869f-4e8f-40c4-8388-892ae476230b-link">3</a></sup> for those with a 33.3% ordinary income tax rate. You’re then able to use losses to offset these taxes, but you’re required to offset gains of the same type as the losses. However, if your losses of one type are more than the gains of that type, then you can use the difference to offset the other type of gain. Here’s an example:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>You had $15,000 in long-term losses</li>



<li>You sold stock A which resulted in $5,000 in long-term gains. You also sold stock B which resulted in $5,000 in short-term gains.</li>



<li>You use $5,000 of the $15,000 in long-term losses to offset your $5,000 in long-term gains. You can also use $5,000 in long-term losses to offset the $5,000 in short-term gains since you don’t have any short-term losses to use.&nbsp;</li>



<li>This leaves you with $5,000 in long-term losses. You can use this extra to offset $3,000 on your income and carry $2,000 in long-term losses into the next year to use on future capital gains.</li>
</ol>



<p>What if you didn’t have any short-term gains to offset with the extra $10,000, though?</p>



<p>Not to worry! You can still use $3,000 of the $10,000 to deduct from your ordinary income and carry forward the extra $7,000 to use in future tax years to offset future gains or future income.</p>

Reducing your ordinary income by $3,000<sup data-fn="50264e2b-470a-487e-8f35-15323fe41ce8" class="fn"><a href="how-to-turn-tax-losses-into-wins-a-playbook-for-tax-loss-harvesting-and-navigating-the-tax-filing-process.html#50264e2b-470a-487e-8f35-15323fe41ce8" id="50264e2b-470a-487e-8f35-15323fe41ce8-link">4</a></sup></h2>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>What does it actually look like when you deduct $3,000 from your ordinary income? </em></p>



<p>Let’s say you didn’t have any dividends last year, but your earned ordinary income was $125,000. You can use the $3,000 to reduce your ordinary income to $122,000. You are then charged your 33.3% interest rate on the $122,000 instead of the $125,000 and you can see the calculations and savings below:&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>$125,000 x .333 = $41,625.00</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>$122,000 x .333 = $40,626.00</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Difference = $999.00&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Basically, the $3,000 deduction will allow you to keep about $1,000 in your pocket. It’s money you no longer have to pay to the IRS.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size">The simple process of filing your tax losses</h3>



<p>It’s the New Year and you’ve probably set some goals for the coming year. You’re also probably thinking about the looming tax deadline and making sure you have all your tax documents ready for it. You’ve signed up for Frec’s direct indexing strategy and you’ve been harvesting losses almost daily. You probably have questions similar to these:&nbsp;</p>



<p>• <em>Does this mean you’ll have to enter in every single transaction?&nbsp;</em><br>• <em>How much time is this going to take to file and will it be worth it?</em></p>



<p>The short answer is no! You do not have to enter in every single trade that got you a tax loss for the year. It shouldn’t increase your filing time any more than it typically takes you or your tax advisor to complete. You only need to enter in a couple of numbers (not hundreds).&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-medium-font-size">Your Consolidated 1099 Tax Form</h3>



<p>At the mid or end of February every year, you’ll receive what is called a 1099 consolidated tax form from Frec. You’ll receive an email from us letting you know it’s available and you’re able to download a pdf of it from the documents tab in the Settings of our platform. There is a summary at the beginning of the form that details out the total short-term or long-term gains or losses. Below is a screenshot example of what your form will look like.</p>

<p>The number for 7 is determined by completing Schedule D, which uses the summary of capital gains and losses for long-term and short-term, but it’s not a transaction by transaction filing. See below for an example of Schedule D.</p>

Assuming 14.7% of your portfolio was tax loss harvested in the first year, that is a total of $7,200. However, that doesn’t mean you receive $7,200 back in your pocket. It means you can apply that number as a loss line item on your tax form. As such, you can use that loss for one of two things:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e1.

Then you can separate these two categories even further into short term and long term. If you hold a stock for longer than a year prior to selling it, it’s considered a long-term capital gain or loss and if it’s less than a year it’s short-term. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason it’s important to know whether your gains are short-term or long-term is because the IRS taxes them differently. Your short term gains will be taxed as ordinary income, while long-term gains are taxed at the capital-gains tax rate. Capital-gains tax rate can be significantly lower than ordinary income tax.

You’re then able to use losses to offset these taxes, but you’re required to offset gains of the same type as the losses. However, if your losses of one type are more than the gains of that type, then you can use the difference to offset the other type of gain. Here’s an example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col class=\"wp-block-list\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eYou had $15,000 in long-term losses\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003eYou sold stock A which resulted in $5,000 in long-term gains. You also sold stock B which resulted in $5,000 in short-term gains.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003eYou use $5,000 of the $15,000 in long-term losses to offset your $5,000 in long-term gains. You can also use $5,000 in long-term losses to offset the $5,000 in short-term gains since you don’t have any short-term losses to use.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003eThis leaves you with $5,000 in long-term losses.

You can still use $3,000 of the $10,000 to deduct from your ordinary income and carry forward the extra $7,000 to use in future tax years to offset future gains or future income.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003e2.

You can use the $3,000 to reduce your ordinary income to $122,000. You are then charged your 33.3% interest rate on the $122,000 instead of the $125,000 and you can see the calculations and savings below:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp class=\"has-text-align-center\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$125,000 x .333 = $41,625.00\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp class=\"has-text-align-center\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$122,000 x .333 = $40,626.00\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp class=\"has-text-align-center\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDifference = $999.00\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBasically, the $3,000 deduction will allow you to keep about $1,000 in your pocket.

Instead, you will repay the interest. And even then, this interest doesn’t even need to be paid right away — you can simply add the amount of interest to the amount you borrowed. Frec’s interest rate is always the Effective Federal Funds rate plus 1%, which is lower than rates for the top five brokerage firms. With a portfolio line of credit, you can hold the borrowed amount indefinitely if your underlying securities continue to perform well and remain stable enough to borrow against.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eWhat is a margin call and why does it have a bad reputation?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere is one circumstance in which you’d have to pay down a portion of the principal, and that is if you receive a \u003cem\u003emargin call\u003c/em\u003e.

Let’s say that you took a portfolio line of credit for $20,000 (which was the max of what you could borrow). If the value of your portfolio drops to $19,000, you will be required to sell some stock or deposit cash to cover the $1,000 difference. Think of a margin call as an enforced “principal repayment” that comes due when the collateral is no longer safe for the lender. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMargin calls have a bad reputation because at most other brokerages, you’re left in the dark about when you might receive a margin call, or what will happen if you do. The old-school providers notify you when it happens without much warning. At Frec, we not only answer all of these questions for you, but we provide tools to help predict the likelihood of your receiving a margin call. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"\u003e\u003cimg data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1956\" height=\"1314\" data-attachment-id=\"378\" data-permalink=\"https://freccom.blog/2023/11/16/the-magic-of-borrowing-against-your-stock-portfolio/card-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/card-2.png?fit=1956%2C1314\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1956,1314\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"card-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/card-2.png?fit=300%2C202\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/card-2.png?fit=1024%2C688\u0026amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/card-2.png?resize=1956%2C1314\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-378\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eWhen you should consider a portfolio line of credit\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSophisticated investors have been employing this technique long time – often via wealth advisors and for the purpose of advanced trading.

Direct indexing is an investment strategy that allows investors to accumulate capital losses while investing in a passive index like the S\u0026amp;P 500. It does so because investors own individual stocks in a specific index, rather than investing in a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the index.

You now find that you’ve stumbled upon your dream house despite the suboptimal housing market and decide to make a down payment.

To employ a TLH strategy, one periodically sells underperforming assets and invests the proceeds in similar — but not “substantially identical” — assets. This creates a taxable loss without significantly altering the investment strategy, which can then offset other taxable gains or be used as a deduction. This approach can be especially beneficial for high-income individuals or those in high-tax jurisdictions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eSummary\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany robo-advisor platforms leverage TLH while simultaneously tracking a major index, by swapping between similarly-performing ETFs during market downturns. There are two main drawbacks of this approach when contrasted with direct indexing. First swapping between ETFs that are not “substantially identical” often results in higher tracking error, e.g. an investor may end with a substantial investment into a Russell 2000 ETF despite aiming to track the S\u0026amp;P 500. Second, because these assets generally reflect broad market performance they don’t allow for loss harvesting at the individual stock level. For instance, consider a recent 12 months of S\u0026amp;P 500 performance during a recovery period (06/2022 – 06/2023), here the overall index generated a return of 14.4%, which would not offer an investor in one of the S\u0026amp;P 500 ETFs an opportunity to harvest losses at the end of this time period. However, as illustrated below, a total of 173 individual constituents were trading at a loss at the end of this period, each of these investments providing an opportunity to harvest capital losses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-large has-custom-border is-style-default\"\u003e\u003cimg data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1922\" height=\"1118\" data-attachment-id=\"209\" data-permalink=\"https://freccom.blog/2023/09/15/frec-direct-indexing-algorithm/chart0/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chart0.jpg?fit=1922%2C1118\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1922,1118\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;1\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"chart0\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chart0.jpg?fit=300%2C175\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chart0.jpg?fit=1024%2C596\u0026amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chart0.jpg?resize=1922%2C1118\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"has-border-color wp-image-209\" style=\"border-color:#e9e5dd;border-width:1px;border-radius:8px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"\u003ePercent return for individual S\u0026amp;P constituents between the dates Jul 1, 2022 \u0026#8211; Jul 1, 2023, sorted in ascending order.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor self-directed investors the efforts required to expertly balance index tracking risk with tax optimization are likely too time-consuming and intricate to justify the advantages. So such optimizations are likely best carried out through algorithmic trading software. Though one should keep in mind that there are many different algorithmic approaches to direct indexing and that solutions available in the marketplace will differ in terms of both the underlying software and the level of transparency into these proprietary approaches. Below we provide a brief explanation of the approach currently employed at \u003ca href=\"https://frec.com\"\u003efrec.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eMethodology\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eGenerally speaking, simply harvesting losses for a given portfolio involves some amount of bookkeeping but in itself presents no great challenge for a software application. However, weighing the tradeoff between deviating from the target index allocations and harvesting losses, and deciding how to strategically reinvest any sale proceeds, entails quite a different level of complexity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe methodology used in Frec Direct Indexing builds on the widely-used formulations in the work on \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eModern Portfolio Theory (MPT)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, also known as \u003cem\u003eMarkowitz Portfolio Optimization\u003c/em\u003e [1,3]. In this report we can only provide a high level description of these concepts but encourage the interested reader to research this area independently as it provides useful context when attempting to understand how our direct indexing algorithms operate. Further, direct indexing involved extending the MPT framework to consider the implication of capital gains taxes and specific tax lots. While much of the details here are not likely of interest to the casual reader we direct more detail is provided on these formulations in the \u003cem\u003eTax-Aware Portfolio Construction\u003c/em\u003e work of Moehle et al. [2], which closely match the formulations and approach used by Frec.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo understand how the benchmark-tracking v.s. loss-harvesting tradeoff is managed, let’s consider some examples. Suppose that the target index on a given day is defined as a list of percentage allocations into individual stocks, e.g. 7.1% APPL, 6.5% MSFT, 3.2% AMZN etc. Now, in our direct index portfolio we would like to harvest $100 in losses in AAPL but it would require us to lower the allocation of AAPL to 5.1% and reallocate that capital (2% of portfolio) elsewhere. There are 2 questions that arise, first how should that 2% be reallocated and, second, is the amount by which we will deviate from the target really worth the $100 loss?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo address the many tradeoffs arising from each individual portfolio we define a scoring function that describes the tradeoffs and the constraints (e.g. avoiding wash sales) explicitly and utilize state-of-the-art numerical solvers to find improved portfolios. The scoring function which the Frec Direct Indexing algorithm attempts to minimize is given as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"\u003e\u003cimg data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"521\" height=\"240\" data-attachment-id=\"183\" data-permalink=\"https://freccom.blog/2023/09/15/frec-direct-indexing-algorithm/equation-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/equation-3.png?fit=521%2C240\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"521,240\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"equation-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/equation-3.png?fit=300%2C138\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/equation-3.png?fit=521%2C240\u0026amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/equation-3.png?resize=521%2C240\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-183\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs a concise summary, this scoring function effectively penalizes the over and under allocation of each stock based on a percentage over/under. In the example above, for the 2% of excess cash the solution that minimizes the above scoring function would reallocate the cash to the other non-AAPL holdings in a way that is over-allocated by the same proportion to their weight. So, MSFT may move up from 6.5% to 7.5% but AMZN would move from 3.2% to 3.7% (both 1.15x over-allocated).\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFinally we come to whether harvesting that $100 in losses for AAPL is worth what we give up in terms of matching the target index allocations. This tradeoff is computed by taking all of these over-under allocation dollar amounts, squaring them, and comparing them directly to the $100 multiplied by the constant factor λ. This factor is set based on hundreds of historical backtesting simulations (detailed below) and we continually optimize this parameter on behalf of our customers in an effort to maximize long-term portfolio returns. If the scoring function results in a lower value by selling and reallocating the 2% of AAPL, then the automated system will do so at the next trading opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMore advanced approaches may also include the correlations between the different stocks in the portfolio, which can improve tracking error even further. While our current empirical studies have not shown a significant performance improvement with this approach we continue to evaluate this direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003ePerformance\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt Frec we take a scientifically rigorous approach to building our investment products, particularly our automated investment strategies such as direct indexing. While there are a number existing academic and industry papers exploring the benefits and drawbacks of direct indexing (see e.g. [4,5,6])\u0026nbsp; it is very challenging to independently verify these findings from the published results. In order to evaluate the performance of our direct indexing implementation for the target index we offer (S\u0026amp;P 500), we elected to run extensive simulations on historical data for S\u0026amp;P 500 constituents going back 20 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eData\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe quality of any simulation is only as good as the underlying data used. We are particularly proud of the considerable efforts taken to produce high-quality simulations and continue to refine our simulations going forward. The dataset used for our simulations come from two sources, first from S\u0026amp;P Global we obtained the historical weighting used by the S\u0026amp;P 500 index on a daily basis going back to 2003. Additionally, we license dividend and split-adjusted daily stock prices from our primary data provider Xignite. Even with high quality data sources there were still dozens of data artifacts (e.g. mergers \u0026amp; acquisitions) and inaccuracies that had to be detected and corrected for, which was done manually by our engineering teams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eHistorical Simulations\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to provide evidence for the performance of direct indexing we consider the results for\u0026nbsp; multiple simulations using overlapping 10 year periods, with starting dates every 90 days, over the period of 12/2003 \u0026#8211; 06/2022. In each of the 36 simulations runs we iterate through time on a weekly basis calling the direct indexing algorithm and simulating the resulting trades. Also, in this section we consider the scenario where there is only a single one-time deposit of $50,000 at the beginning of the simulation time period\u003csup data-fn=\"ff7c027e-7595-4973-b10d-df8460102008\" class=\"fn\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#ff7c027e-7595-4973-b10d-df8460102008\" id=\"ff7c027e-7595-4973-b10d-df8460102008-link\"\u003e2\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e. While direct indexing does indeed work best when regular deposits are used, the performance implications of each of these deposits can generally be considered in isolation, more on this below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eImportantly, two different direct indexing simulations were conducted, the first simulation does not assume any of the tax losses harvested are reinvested into the portfolio while the second assumes that any tax losses can be converted into cash quarterly using an assumed tax rate of 42.3%. This latter tax rate represents an investor in the 95-98th percentile tax bracket as is described in the “Investor A” profile of Khang et al. [5]. To illustrate, consider simulation results from the period 2003-12-17 to 2013-10-23, below is a time series of capital losses incurred in each of these simulations:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-large has-custom-border\"\u003e\u003cimg data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2140\" height=\"1080\" data-attachment-id=\"199\" data-permalink=\"https://freccom.blog/2023/09/15/frec-direct-indexing-algorithm/chart1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chart1.jpg?fit=2140%2C1080\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2140,1080\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;1\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"chart1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chart1.jpg?fit=300%2C151\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chart1.jpg?fit=1024%2C517\u0026amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chart1.jpg?resize=2140%2C1080\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-199\" style=\"border-width:1px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"\u003eCapital losses for direct indexing with reinvestment (blue, ID: 19fc) and no reinvestment (green, ID: ad6a).\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHere, the capital losses for the reinvestment simulation (ID: 19fc) are significantly higher, as cash obtained by tax savings reinvested into the account grants further opportunities for tax loss harvesting.

The reinvestment scenario represents near the best case for direct indexing, assuming that the investor has capital gains each year that can be written off and reinvested in the market immediately. The scenario without reinvestment represents somewhat of the worst case scenario for this time period, where the investor at the end of the period has carried forward $25.5k losses (51% of the initial deposit) the value of these losses can be assessed by the individual familiar with their tax situation. Finally, by leaving out reinvestment we can understand how closely the direct indexing portfolio matches the performance of the target S\u0026amp;P 500 index, in this example the final portfolio value is within 0.3% of target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eMultiple Simulation Results\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to get a better overall understanding of the performance for direct index we may consider the aggregate results of multiple simulations over different time periods. Here, unfortunately, the data available for backtesting simulations is somewhat limited by the quality and resolutions of historical data. Especially when we consider that direct indexing is a long-term investing strategy and must therefore be evaluated on time periods relevant to the curious investor.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn light of this, we elected to run overlapping simulations on the historical data in an attempt to make the most of what data is available. Specifically, 10 year periods with 90-day staggered starting dates were used for our analysis, for example, the first simulation ran for the period 2003-12-17 to 2013-10-23, the second simulation ran from 2004-03-16 to 2014-01-23, and so on, overall a total of 36 such simulations were conducted. Note, that the results for these simulations are deterministic so multiple simulation runs on the same time period are not required or desirable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs mentioned above, these simulation runs consider only the single $50,000 deposit setting as we feel that this setting provides the most clarity into the performance of direct indexing. In the regular deposit setting individual deposits can have some interaction, e.g. deposits can help fill in underweight positions sooner rather than waiting for a loss harvest opportunity, but these interactions have a relatively insignificant effect on the total losses harvested. As such, one can likely best understand the benefits of a multiple deposit setting by simply adding up the expected benefit of each deposit individually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe primary statistics of interest for direct indexing relate to the question of how much capital loss can one expect to capture, and when in the lifetime of the portfolio can these losses be expected to occur. To answer these questions consider the following figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-large has-custom-border\"\u003e\u003cimg data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1850\" height=\"1134\" data-attachment-id=\"193\" data-permalink=\"https://freccom.blog/2023/09/15/frec-direct-indexing-algorithm/chart3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chart3.jpg?fit=1850%2C1134\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1850,1134\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;1\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"chart3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chart3.jpg?fit=300%2C184\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chart3.jpg?fit=1024%2C628\u0026amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chart3.jpg?resize=1850%2C1134\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-193\" style=\"border-width:1px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"\u003eAverage harvested losses in each year following the initial deposit as a percentage of the deposit, error bars are shown at two standard deviations\u003csup data-fn=\"4b13729c-67ab-4a6e-841c-af34c309b736\" class=\"fn\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#4b13729c-67ab-4a6e-841c-af34c309b736\" id=\"4b13729c-67ab-4a6e-841c-af34c309b736-link\"\u003e3\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHere the losses are averaged over all 36 simulations for each year following the deposit and plotted above as a percentage of the initial deposit. After 10 years the direct indexing algorithm harvested losses summing to 45% of the initial deposit ($22,567) when reinvesting and 40% ($19,820) without reinvesting losses. Additionally, this data indicates that the large majority of the tax losses harvested occur in the first few years of a deposit, with more than half of the losses occurring within the first 2 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNext we consider the question of how much additional return might be expected from utilizing the direct indexing strategy. To answer this question, simulations where losses are reinvested into the portfolio become necessary simply due to the fact that if the losses harvested from direct indexing are never utilized then no financial benefits can be observed. Recall that for the reinvestment case losses are reinvested quarterly at an assumed tax rate of 42.3%, e.g. if $100 of net losses are harvested in Q1 year 3 at the end of the quarter an additional $42.30 will be deposited into the account and reallocated by the direct indexing algorithm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-large has-custom-border is-style-default\"\u003e\u003cimg data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1878\" height=\"1112\" data-attachment-id=\"221\" data-permalink=\"https://freccom.blog/2023/09/15/frec-direct-indexing-algorithm/chart4-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chart4-2.jpg?fit=1878%2C1112\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1878,1112\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;1\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"chart4-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chart4-2.jpg?fit=300%2C178\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chart4-2.jpg?fit=1024%2C606\u0026amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chart4-2.jpg?resize=1878%2C1112\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-221\" style=\"border-width:1px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"\u003eAverage excess return (portfolio value \u0026#8211; benchmark value) as a percentage of the initial deposit, error bars are shown at two standard deviations\u003csup\u003e3\u003c/sup\u003e.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe above figure shows the excess returns as a percentage of the initial deposit relative to the benchmark (SPY ETF) averaged over all 36 simulation runs with and without reinvestment.

Additionally, these harvested losses tend to occur relatively soon after the deposit is made, which is expected since the cost basis of the purchased assets are most similar to their market prices immediately after purchase. Any small drop in prices will therefore lead to an opportunity to harvest losses, leading to a secondary effect: the repurchase of more stocks at their new cost basis.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile it’s generally a good thing that the benefits occur early, so that they may be realized and reinvested sooner, one can also make the observation that the benefits of direct indexing diminish over time. Again, this generally makes sense as we expect the assets in our portfolio to grow over time away from their cost basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have any questions about the details, feel free to reach out at \u003ca href=\"mailto:help@frec.com\"\u003ehelp@frec.com\u003c/a\u003e or schedule a call \u003ca href=\"https://calendly.com/frecteam/introductory-call-frec\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003chr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eReferences\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp class=\"has-x-small-font-size\"\u003e[1] Markowitz, H.: Portfolio Selection.
