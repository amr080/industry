<p>Sebastian is the 39-year-old CEO of a DevOps startup. He lives in a major city with his wife and their 11-month-old baby, and they have another baby on the way.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Before Frec</h2>



<p>When it comes to investing, Sebastian has been around the block. He was Customer #7 at Wealthfront back in 2010, and he’s worked with dozens of financial institutions. He likes to test out different platforms, gauge the user experience, and find and report bugs. If the platform earns his trust, he’ll transfer more and more funds.</p>



<p>Frec is the most recent platform to earn Sebastian’s trust. He has the same feeling about Frec as he did about Wealthfront when he first tried it — that it’s going to be the next big thing.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Sebastian’s investing philosophy</h3>



<p>“I&#8217;m one of those weirdos that believe that we&#8217;re going to live forever,” Sebastian told us, “so my time horizon is quite long. And so most of my financial discipline comes from the bet that we&#8217;re going to live exceedingly long lives.”</p>



<p>And because he’s thinking on very long time scales, he says, “I really like the risk-adjusted returns that you get from investing in the American market with a well-diversified portfolio.”&nbsp;“One of my core beliefs is that, if you just look at the performance of the S&amp;P 500 for the last 50 years, it&#8217;s been around 9-10% yearly<sup data-fn="74a286e9-a121-40de-834d-26e1403f4e4e" class="fn"><a href="meet-sebastian.html#74a286e9-a121-40de-834d-26e1403f4e4e" id="74a286e9-a121-40de-834d-26e1403f4e4e-link">1</a></sup>. If you look at the average interest rates over the same period, they’ve been 4% or 5%<sup data-fn="db361927-b39d-4af2-ba51-180af39f8323" class="fn"><a href="meet-sebastian.html#db361927-b39d-4af2-ba51-180af39f8323" id="db361927-b39d-4af2-ba51-180af39f8323-link">2</a></sup>. And so a couple of years ago, I decided that I would be long on equities and short on cash and just have that long, long-term position.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why Frec?</h2>



<p>Sebastian first learned about Frec from Twitter. “What caught my eye was the funding from <a href="http://greylock.com">Greylock</a>. I have a huge amount of respect for the firm. And I just thought, well, if they invested, it&#8217;s probably something to look into.”</p>



<p>When he saw that Frec was SEC-registered, he knew that meant they’d been through rigorous compliance checks. “That gave me enough confidence to put in the first deposit.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Low barrier to direct indexing</h3>



<p>Sebastian switched to Frec because he already knew he wanted to start direct indexing, and Frec was the easiest place to do that.</p>



<p>“Right now a huge portion of my assets are just in VTI or these big ETFs. I&#8217;m probably never going to sell those just because I don&#8217;t want to pay the capital gains on them, but that means I&#8217;m starting from scratch on adding new money, and I&#8217;d rather that go directly into direct indexing than just buying more VTI.”</p>



<p>Sebastian previously had his assets in Wealthfront, but they only offer direct indexing to customers with over $100,000 on the platform. Since Frec’s minimum is only $20,000, “it makes it much easier to get started with direct indexing.” Plus, Wealthfront <a href="https://research.wealthfront.com/whitepapers/stock-level-tax-loss-harvesting/">sometimes uses ETFs</a> as part of their direct indexing strategy—which is exactly the kind of thing that Sebastian wanted to diversify from. Frec’s approach is a pure form of direct indexing: no ETFs are involved at all.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Simple margin rates</h3>



<p>The main reason Sebastian left Wealthfront was their high margin rates. He realized that he would eventually want to buy a house, “and I don&#8217;t want to sell equities and pay all those capital gains. I&#8217;d much rather take on a margin loan to cover the down payment and stay invested for the longer term.”</p>



<p>So he transferred his money to Interactive Brokers, seeking lower margin rates. Soon after, he switched to Frec because it had a low margin <em>and</em> the direct indexing capability he was looking for.</p>



<p>Sebastian appreciates how simple Frec makes margin rates. “Once I started using Frec, what&#8217;s been cool is just generally how much easier it is to understand everything that goes on – specifically dividends received, interest paid on margin, and a well designed activity stream.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Easy-to-understand product &amp; interfaces</h3>



<p>Sebastian has found Frec’s interfaces to be intuitive and helpful. It’s easy to understand what’s going on in his accounts, and that makes Frec an attractive option for managing his family’s assets, which are currently spread out across about 30 different institutions.</p>



<p>One of the things he likes most is how easy it is to understand tax lots with Frec. “Let&#8217;s say, for example, you&#8217;ve got some Apple stock, and you bought that over many years. It&#8217;s really easy to double click on that and see all the different tax lots.You can see that you bought some at $20 and $30 and $40. As far as I know, there&#8217;s no other platform that makes it really easy to figure out tax lots. And that&#8217;s super important if you’re looking to dollar cost average or sell the most expensive of your tax lots at the end of the year. That portion of the interface is very well thought through.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Recap</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Sebastian has tried dozens of finance platforms.</strong> As a DevOps junkie, he loves testing out new platforms to gauge the user experience, and find and report bugs. If a platform has great UX and is quick to fix bugs, they earn his trust—and Frec has.</li>



<li><strong>He’s investing for the (very) long term.</strong> Sebastian likes to think we’ll live for a hundred years, and he invests with that in mind. For him, that means tracking the market—and he thinks direct indexing is the best way to do that.</li>



<li><strong>Sebastian switched to Frec to diversify away from ETFs.</strong> A large portion of Sebastian’s assets are in ETFs, and he realized he was unlikely to ever sell them, due to the taxes. So he knew he wanted to start direct indexing, and Frec was the easiest place to do that.</li>



<li><strong>Frec’s low margin rates were also a big part of the appeal.</strong> Sebastian wants to buy a house in the future, and he’d rather take on a margin loan for the downpayment—not sell equities and have to pay taxes on the capital gains. Frec has low margin rates, and makes them easy to understand.</li>



<li><strong>He thinks Frec is the next big thing.</strong> Sebastian knows what goes into founding a startup (he’s done it himself). He was Customer #7 at Wealthfront back in 2010. He has a lot of faith in Frec’s team and is excited at the rate of improvement and growth he’s seen so far.</li>
</ul>



<p>He’s excited to continue working with Frec, because he’s “seeing the rate at which the software is improving and thinking” in ten years, </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“[Frec] is going to be the next big finance platform and I want to be a part of that.”</p>

He lives in a major city with his wife and their 11-month-old baby, and they have another baby on the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eBefore Frec\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to investing, Sebastian has been around the block. He was Customer #7 at Wealthfront back in 2010, and he’s worked with dozens of financial institutions. He likes to test out different platforms, gauge the user experience, and find and report bugs. If the platform earns his trust, he’ll transfer more and more funds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFrec is the most recent platform to earn Sebastian’s trust. He has the same feeling about Frec as he did about Wealthfront when he first tried it — that it’s going to be the next big thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eSebastian’s investing philosophy\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0026#8217;m one of those weirdos that believe that we\u0026#8217;re going to live forever,” Sebastian told us, “so my time horizon is quite long. And so most of my financial discipline comes from the bet that we\u0026#8217;re going to live exceedingly long lives.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd because he’s thinking on very long time scales, he says, “I really like the risk-adjusted returns that you get from investing in the American market with a well-diversified portfolio.”\u0026nbsp;“One of my core beliefs is that, if you just look at the performance of the S\u0026amp;P 500 for the last 50 years, it\u0026#8217;s been around 9-10% yearly\u003csup data-fn=\"74a286e9-a121-40de-834d-26e1403f4e4e\" class=\"fn\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#74a286e9-a121-40de-834d-26e1403f4e4e\" id=\"74a286e9-a121-40de-834d-26e1403f4e4e-link\"\u003e1\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e.

And so a couple of years ago, I decided that I would be long on equities and short on cash and just have that long, long-term position.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eWhy Frec?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian first learned about Frec from Twitter. “What caught my eye was the funding from \u003ca href=\"http://greylock.com\"\u003eGreylock\u003c/a\u003e. I have a huge amount of respect for the firm. And I just thought, well, if they invested, it\u0026#8217;s probably something to look into.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he saw that Frec was SEC-registered, he knew that meant they’d been through rigorous compliance checks. “That gave me enough confidence to put in the first deposit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eLow barrier to direct indexing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian switched to Frec because he already knew he wanted to start direct indexing, and Frec was the easiest place to do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Right now a huge portion of my assets are just in VTI or these big ETFs. I\u0026#8217;m probably never going to sell those just because I don\u0026#8217;t want to pay the capital gains on them, but that means I\u0026#8217;m starting from scratch on adding new money, and I\u0026#8217;d rather that go directly into direct indexing than just buying more VTI.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian previously had his assets in Wealthfront, but they only offer direct indexing to customers with over $100,000 on the platform. Since Frec’s minimum is only $20,000, “it makes it much easier to get started with direct indexing.” Plus, Wealthfront \u003ca href=\"https://research.wealthfront.com/whitepapers/stock-level-tax-loss-harvesting/\"\u003esometimes uses ETFs\u003c/a\u003e as part of their direct indexing strategy—which is exactly the kind of thing that Sebastian wanted to diversify from. Frec’s approach is a pure form of direct indexing: no ETFs are involved at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eSimple margin rates\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe main reason Sebastian left Wealthfront was their high margin rates. He realized that he would eventually want to buy a house, “and I don\u0026#8217;t want to sell equities and pay all those capital gains. I\u0026#8217;d much rather take on a margin loan to cover the down payment and stay invested for the longer term.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo he transferred his money to Interactive Brokers, seeking lower margin rates. Soon after, he switched to Frec because it had a low margin \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e the direct indexing capability he was looking for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian appreciates how simple Frec makes margin rates. “Once I started using Frec, what\u0026#8217;s been cool is just generally how much easier it is to understand everything that goes on – specifically dividends received, interest paid on margin, and a well designed activity stream.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eEasy-to-understand product \u0026amp; interfaces\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian has found Frec’s interfaces to be intuitive and helpful. It’s easy to understand what’s going on in his accounts, and that makes Frec an attractive option for managing his family’s assets, which are currently spread out across about 30 different institutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the things he likes most is how easy it is to understand tax lots with Frec. “Let\u0026#8217;s say, for example, you\u0026#8217;ve got some Apple stock, and you bought that over many years. It\u0026#8217;s really easy to double click on that and see all the different tax lots.You can see that you bought some at $20 and $30 and $40. As far as I know, there\u0026#8217;s no other platform that makes it really easy to figure out tax lots. And that\u0026#8217;s super important if you’re looking to dollar cost average or sell the most expensive of your tax lots at the end of the year. That portion of the interface is very well thought through.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eRecap\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul class=\"wp-block-list\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSebastian has tried dozens of finance platforms.\u003c/strong\u003e As a DevOps junkie, he loves testing out new platforms to gauge the user experience, and find and report bugs.

But none of the products he saw on the market were quite what he was looking for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne shop wanted him to pay 1% per annum on his assets, plus an additional 0.20% to use their direct indexing platform. That pricing didn’t work for Richard. Another shop he called charged 0.25%, “but I didn\u0026#8217;t like the way the product was structured. They forced clients to put money into their asset allocation program in order to get access to direct indexing sleeve.” Yet another shop told him their tax loss harvesting product was available to clients of financial advisors but not to the company’s own direct long-time customers.\u0026nbsp; In other cases, the minimum investment sizes were prohibitive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eUltimately, Richard signed up for a tax loss harvesting account that charged 0.40%. He was happy with the performance, especially since the market was in a downturn in 2022 and there were plenty of losses to be harvested, “but I had this idea in mind that it really shouldn\u0026#8217;t cost 0.40%.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHe kept looking for a product with lower pricing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eWhy Frec?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRichard first heard about Frec on investor Howard Lindzon’s \u003ca href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/trends-with-friends/id1670692277\"\u003epodcast\u003c/a\u003e.

At his previous brokerage, Richard was paying 0.40% for monthly harvesting, which delivered inferior results. “Here at Frec, they\u0026#8217;re doing it daily, and… it\u0026#8217;s priced at 0.10%, which is what it should be priced at.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn the whole, Richard thinks Frec direct indexing has “a clear competitive advantage.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eThe people\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRichard is impressed with Frec’s product, “but the thing that really makes me feel good about sending hundreds of thousands of dollars into my account at Frec is the people.
