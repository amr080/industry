<p>We are thrilled to announce that Frec has reached $100 million in customer assets, just nine months after our launch. This achievement reflects the growing demand for our innovative direct indexing platform, which makes sophisticated investment strategies accessible to individual investors.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Expanding our direct indexing suite</h2>



<p>In response to customer feedback and as part of our commitment to expanding direct indexing investment options, we&#8217;re excited to introduce seven new indices to our platform:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>S&amp;P Developed Markets ADR</li>



<li>Russell 1000</li>



<li>Russell 2000</li>



<li>Russell 3000</li>



<li>CRSP ISS US Large Cap ESG</li>



<li>CRSP Mid Cap</li>



<li>S&amp;P 500 Shariah</li>
</ol>



<p>With these additions, our total offering now includes twelve indices, making Frec the first consumer investment platform to provide such a diverse range of direct indexing options.<sup data-fn="fdf045ac-60ad-45fe-bd26-2a179fff5fa9" class="fn"><a href="100-million.html#fdf045ac-60ad-45fe-bd26-2a179fff5fa9" id="fdf045ac-60ad-45fe-bd26-2a179fff5fa9-link">1</a></sup> We&#8217;re particularly proud of our partnership with Russell, whose indices serve as leading benchmarks for institutional investors. This collaboration underscores our commitment to bringing institutional-grade investment solutions to you, our individual investors.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The power of direct indexing</h2>



<p>For those new to the concept, direct indexing allows you to own the individual components of an index directly. This approach enables you to track the returns of an index while potentially benefiting from tax-loss harvesting opportunities, which can enhance your after-tax returns. Research shows that direct indexing can provide 2-3x more opportunities for tax-loss harvesting than ETFs.<sup data-fn="b9cfa8ef-bc7e-4988-a82e-fe11bf7446f2" class="fn"><a href="100-million.html#b9cfa8ef-bc7e-4988-a82e-fe11bf7446f2" id="b9cfa8ef-bc7e-4988-a82e-fe11bf7446f2-link">2</a></sup></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Our vision for the future</h2>



<p>Industry projections suggest that direct indexing is poised for significant growth, potentially outpacing ETFs, mutual funds, and separately managed accounts (SMAs). The strategy is expected to reach $800 billion in assets by 2026<sup data-fn="87985c05-f611-4e51-a7d2-f358a2246d14" class="fn"><a href="100-million.html#87985c05-f611-4e51-a7d2-f358a2246d14" id="87985c05-f611-4e51-a7d2-f358a2246d14-link">3</a></sup>, and we&#8217;re excited to be at the forefront of this trend.</p>



<p>Our CEO, Mo Al Adham, shares his perspective: &#8220;Reaching this $100 million milestone in less than a year is an indication of the underlying demand for direct indexing. We&#8217;re on a mission to bring it to every investor. We believe that direct indexing will do to ETFs what ETFs did to mutual funds. In our view, it&#8217;s simply a better way to passively invest in the market.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Looking<strong><em> </em></strong>ahead</h2>



<p>As we continue to grow, our focus remains on expanding our suite of offerings to meet your needs. &#8220;Ultimately, I see us offering a direct index for every version of the most popular ETFs,&#8221; Al Adham notes.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re proud of what we&#8217;ve achieved so far, but we recognize that this is just the beginning. We remain committed to innovating and improving our platform to help you, our customers.</p>

He was Customer #7 at Wealthfront back in 2010, and he’s worked with dozens of financial institutions. He likes to test out different platforms, gauge the user experience, and find and report bugs. If the platform earns his trust, he’ll transfer more and more funds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFrec is the most recent platform to earn Sebastian’s trust. He has the same feeling about Frec as he did about Wealthfront when he first tried it — that it’s going to be the next big thing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eSebastian’s investing philosophy\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“I\u0026#8217;m one of those weirdos that believe that we\u0026#8217;re going to live forever,” Sebastian told us, “so my time horizon is quite long.

I have a huge amount of respect for the firm. And I just thought, well, if they invested, it\u0026#8217;s probably something to look into.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen he saw that Frec was SEC-registered, he knew that meant they’d been through rigorous compliance checks. “That gave me enough confidence to put in the first deposit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eLow barrier to direct indexing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian switched to Frec because he already knew he wanted to start direct indexing, and Frec was the easiest place to do that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“Right now a huge portion of my assets are just in VTI or these big ETFs. I\u0026#8217;m probably never going to sell those just because I don\u0026#8217;t want to pay the capital gains on them, but that means I\u0026#8217;m starting from scratch on adding new money, and I\u0026#8217;d rather that go directly into direct indexing than just buying more VTI.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian previously had his assets in Wealthfront, but they only offer direct indexing to customers with over $100,000 on the platform. Since Frec’s minimum is only $20,000, “it makes it much easier to get started with direct indexing.” Plus, Wealthfront \u003ca href=\"https://research.wealthfront.com/whitepapers/stock-level-tax-loss-harvesting/\"\u003esometimes uses ETFs\u003c/a\u003e as part of their direct indexing strategy—which is exactly the kind of thing that Sebastian wanted to diversify from. Frec’s approach is a pure form of direct indexing: no ETFs are involved at all.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eSimple margin rates\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe main reason Sebastian left Wealthfront was their high margin rates. He realized that he would eventually want to buy a house, “and I don\u0026#8217;t want to sell equities and pay all those capital gains. I\u0026#8217;d much rather take on a margin loan to cover the down payment and stay invested for the longer term.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo he transferred his money to Interactive Brokers, seeking lower margin rates. Soon after, he switched to Frec because it had a low margin \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e the direct indexing capability he was looking for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian appreciates how simple Frec makes margin rates. “Once I started using Frec, what\u0026#8217;s been cool is just generally how much easier it is to understand everything that goes on – specifically dividends received, interest paid on margin, and a well designed activity stream.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eEasy-to-understand product \u0026amp; interfaces\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian has found Frec’s interfaces to be intuitive and helpful. It’s easy to understand what’s going on in his accounts, and that makes Frec an attractive option for managing his family’s assets, which are currently spread out across about 30 different institutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the things he likes most is how easy it is to understand tax lots with Frec. “Let\u0026#8217;s say, for example, you\u0026#8217;ve got some Apple stock, and you bought that over many years. It\u0026#8217;s really easy to double click on that and see all the different tax lots.You can see that you bought some at $20 and $30 and $40. As far as I know, there\u0026#8217;s no other platform that makes it really easy to figure out tax lots. And that\u0026#8217;s super important if you’re looking to dollar cost average or sell the most expensive of your tax lots at the end of the year. That portion of the interface is very well thought through.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eRecap\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul class=\"wp-block-list\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSebastian has tried dozens of finance platforms.\u003c/strong\u003e As a DevOps junkie, he loves testing out new platforms to gauge the user experience, and find and report bugs.
