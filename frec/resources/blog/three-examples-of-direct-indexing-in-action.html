class="wordpress">
<p>It’s been a great year. You hit it big…</p>



<p>You still can’t believe your college roommate, who used to sleep until noon, founded a company set to IPO. Looks like that $20,000 angel check you wrote him 15 years ago was worth it.</p>



<p>Now you’re left with hundreds of thousands of capital gains and you know the tax man is going to knock on your door. And no, Grandpa’s 95-year-old CPA can’t help you get out of this one. </p>



<p>What to do now? Cue Frec Direct Indexing. Direct indexing is an investment strategy that allows investors to accumulate capital losses while investing in a passive index like the S&amp;P 500. It does so because investors own individual stocks in a specific index, rather than investing in a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the index. While the use cases are myriad, below we’ve highlighted some of the principal advantages. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Supercharged tax loss harvesting gets you more</h2>



<p>Arguably the biggest benefit of direct indexing is the ability to harvest tax losses. You’ve heard the term before but you’ve always thought direct indexing was reserved for wealth managers. Maybe you didn’t even know it existed. Can a tax break really matter that much? I think you already know the answer.</p>



<p>Let’s say you moved your $500,000 portfolio over to Frec Direct Indexing a year ago and it has been harvesting daily losses. You now find that you’ve stumbled upon your dream house despite the suboptimal housing market and decide to make a down payment. So, you sell your shares of your friend&#8217;s now post-IPO company. You could save as much as $31,090<sup data-fn="2f22b8e1-ac1d-467c-911c-c25f40ba0638" class="fn"><a href="three-examples-of-direct-indexing-in-action.html#2f22b8e1-ac1d-467c-911c-c25f40ba0638" id="2f22b8e1-ac1d-467c-911c-c25f40ba0638-link">1</a></sup> on your capital gain taxes just by offsetting those gains on your tax bill. </p>



<p>Tax loss harvesting can help you reduce your overall tax bill, especially in years when you have realized significant capital gains. Some platforms offer ETF-to-ETF tax loss harvesting, but these are less savings as they’re not harvesting on the individual stock level. Better yet, you carry your tax losses forward if you don’t use them in a particular year.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Personalization lets you make the index your own</h2>



<p>Let’s say you work at one of those cushy tech jobs like Apple. Your pay package includes a sizable equity plan and you’ve quietly drummed up quite a position. Meanwhile, you want to diversify your portfolio by investing in the S&amp;P 500. You realize that Apple makes up 6.90%<sup data-fn="f6fde748-e8f1-444a-b9a2-c9c94c5dc7d4" class="fn"><a href="three-examples-of-direct-indexing-in-action.html#f6fde748-e8f1-444a-b9a2-c9c94c5dc7d4" id="f6fde748-e8f1-444a-b9a2-c9c94c5dc7d4-link">2</a></sup> of the S&amp;P and think the only option is to invest in an ETF tracking the index &#8211; meaning, you would be forced to buy even more Apple stock. The opposite of what you wanted.</p>



<p>Not anymore. With direct indexing, you can customize your S&amp;P portfolio by simply excluding Apple, enjoying a level of personalization and customization not available in traditional index or ETF investing. You could even go as far as creating your own index.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Easy transfers avoid selling your stocks</h2>



<p>You work in Silicon Valley and you have been bullish on tech so a large portion of your $1 million portfolio is in early positions you took on Apple and Nvidia. After a strong 5 years for both, you find yourself well overexposed. And sure you think they may continue to go up, but you’re not counting on it. You wanted a diversified portfolio, not a portfolio comprised mostly of two stocks. With Frec Direct Indexing, you don’t have to sell each stock and rebuy it, incurring significant capital gain taxes. Instead, you can simply transfer the target allocations of Apple and Nvidia, in stock, potentially saving yourself thousands in dollars in taxes.</p>



<p>“Nothing is certain except death and taxes.” Many of us are brutally reminded of Benjamin Franklin’s famous quote every April 15th. <strong><mark style="background-color:#dcfe52" class="has-inline-color">With Frec Direct Indexing, you optimize for both returns <em>and</em> tax savings. Because at the end of the day, it’s not how much you earn that matters – but how much you keep.</mark></strong></p>

You hit it big…\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou still can’t believe your college roommate, who used to sleep until noon, founded a company set to IPO. Looks like that $20,000 angel check you wrote him 15 years ago was worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow you’re left with hundreds of thousands of capital gains and you know the tax man is going to knock on your door. And no, Grandpa’s 95-year-old CPA can’t help you get out of this one. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat to do now? Cue Frec Direct Indexing. Direct indexing is an investment strategy that allows investors to accumulate capital losses while investing in a passive index like the S\u0026amp;P 500. It does so because investors own individual stocks in a specific index, rather than investing in a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the index. While the use cases are myriad, below we’ve highlighted some of the principal advantages. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eSupercharged tax loss harvesting gets you more\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eArguably the biggest benefit of direct indexing is the ability to harvest tax losses. You’ve heard the term before but you’ve always thought direct indexing was reserved for wealth managers. Maybe you didn’t even know it existed. Can a tax break really matter that much? I think you already know the answer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s say you moved your $500,000 portfolio over to Frec Direct Indexing a year ago and it has been harvesting daily losses. You now find that you’ve stumbled upon your dream house despite the suboptimal housing market and decide to make a down payment. So, you sell your shares of your friend\u0026#8217;s now post-IPO company. You could save as much as $31,090\u003csup data-fn=\"2f22b8e1-ac1d-467c-911c-c25f40ba0638\" class=\"fn\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#2f22b8e1-ac1d-467c-911c-c25f40ba0638\" id=\"2f22b8e1-ac1d-467c-911c-c25f40ba0638-link\"\u003e1\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e on your capital gain taxes just by offsetting those gains on your tax bill. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTax loss harvesting can help you reduce your overall tax bill, especially in years when you have realized significant capital gains. Some platforms offer ETF-to-ETF tax loss harvesting, but these are less savings as they’re not harvesting on the individual stock level.

To employ a TLH strategy, one periodically sells underperforming assets and invests the proceeds in similar — but not “substantially identical” — assets. This creates a taxable loss without significantly altering the investment strategy, which can then offset other taxable gains or be used as a deduction. This approach can be especially beneficial for high-income individuals or those in high-tax jurisdictions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eSummary\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany robo-advisor platforms leverage TLH while simultaneously tracking a major index, by swapping between similarly-performing ETFs during market downturns. There are two main drawbacks of this approach when contrasted with direct indexing. First swapping between ETFs that are not “substantially identical” often results in higher tracking error, e.g. an investor may end with a substantial investment into a Russell 2000 ETF despite aiming to track the S\u0026amp;P 500. Second, because these assets generally reflect broad market performance they don’t allow for loss harvesting at the individual stock level. For instance, consider a recent 12 months of S\u0026amp;P 500 performance during a recovery period (06/2022 – 06/2023), here the overall index generated a return of 14.4%, which would not offer an investor in one of the S\u0026amp;P 500 ETFs an opportunity to harvest losses at the end of this time period. However, as illustrated below, a total of 173 individual constituents were trading at a loss at the end of this period, each of these investments providing an opportunity to harvest capital losses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-large has-custom-border is-style-default\"\u003e\u003cimg data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1922\" height=\"1118\" data-attachment-id=\"209\" data-permalink=\"https://freccom.blog/2023/09/15/frec-direct-indexing-algorithm/chart0/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chart0.jpg?fit=1922%2C1118\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1922,1118\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;1\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"chart0\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chart0.jpg?fit=300%2C175\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chart0.jpg?fit=1024%2C596\u0026amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chart0.jpg?resize=1922%2C1118\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"has-border-color wp-image-209\" style=\"border-color:#e9e5dd;border-width:1px;border-radius:8px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"\u003ePercent return for individual S\u0026amp;P constituents between the dates Jul 1, 2022 \u0026#8211; Jul 1, 2023, sorted in ascending order.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor self-directed investors the efforts required to expertly balance index tracking risk with tax optimization are likely too time-consuming and intricate to justify the advantages. So such optimizations are likely best carried out through algorithmic trading software. Though one should keep in mind that there are many different algorithmic approaches to direct indexing and that solutions available in the marketplace will differ in terms of both the underlying software and the level of transparency into these proprietary approaches. Below we provide a brief explanation of the approach currently employed at \u003ca href=\"https://frec.com\"\u003efrec.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eMethodology\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eGenerally speaking, simply harvesting losses for a given portfolio involves some amount of bookkeeping but in itself presents no great challenge for a software application. However, weighing the tradeoff between deviating from the target index allocations and harvesting losses, and deciding how to strategically reinvest any sale proceeds, entails quite a different level of complexity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe methodology used in Frec Direct Indexing builds on the widely-used formulations in the work on \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eModern Portfolio Theory (MPT)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, also known as \u003cem\u003eMarkowitz Portfolio Optimization\u003c/em\u003e [1,3]. In this report we can only provide a high level description of these concepts but encourage the interested reader to research this area independently as it provides useful context when attempting to understand how our direct indexing algorithms operate. Further, direct indexing involved extending the MPT framework to consider the implication of capital gains taxes and specific tax lots. While much of the details here are not likely of interest to the casual reader we direct more detail is provided on these formulations in the \u003cem\u003eTax-Aware Portfolio Construction\u003c/em\u003e work of Moehle et al. [2], which closely match the formulations and approach used by Frec.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo understand how the benchmark-tracking v.s. loss-harvesting tradeoff is managed, let’s consider some examples. Suppose that the target index on a given day is defined as a list of percentage allocations into individual stocks, e.g. 7.1% APPL, 6.5% MSFT, 3.2% AMZN etc. Now, in our direct index portfolio we would like to harvest $100 in losses in AAPL but it would require us to lower the allocation of AAPL to 5.1% and reallocate that capital (2% of portfolio) elsewhere. There are 2 questions that arise, first how should that 2% be reallocated and, second, is the amount by which we will deviate from the target really worth the $100 loss?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo address the many tradeoffs arising from each individual portfolio we define a scoring function that describes the tradeoffs and the constraints (e.g. avoiding wash sales) explicitly and utilize state-of-the-art numerical solvers to find improved portfolios. The scoring function which the Frec Direct Indexing algorithm attempts to minimize is given as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-large\"\u003e\u003cimg data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"521\" height=\"240\" data-attachment-id=\"183\" data-permalink=\"https://freccom.blog/2023/09/15/frec-direct-indexing-algorithm/equation-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/equation-3.png?fit=521%2C240\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"521,240\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"equation-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/equation-3.png?fit=300%2C138\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/equation-3.png?fit=521%2C240\u0026amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/equation-3.png?resize=521%2C240\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-183\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs a concise summary, this scoring function effectively penalizes the over and under allocation of each stock based on a percentage over/under. In the example above, for the 2% of excess cash the solution that minimizes the above scoring function would reallocate the cash to the other non-AAPL holdings in a way that is over-allocated by the same proportion to their weight. So, MSFT may move up from 6.5% to 7.5% but AMZN would move from 3.2% to 3.7% (both 1.15x over-allocated).\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFinally we come to whether harvesting that $100 in losses for AAPL is worth what we give up in terms of matching the target index allocations. This tradeoff is computed by taking all of these over-under allocation dollar amounts, squaring them, and comparing them directly to the $100 multiplied by the constant factor λ. This factor is set based on hundreds of historical backtesting simulations (detailed below) and we continually optimize this parameter on behalf of our customers in an effort to maximize long-term portfolio returns. If the scoring function results in a lower value by selling and reallocating the 2% of AAPL, then the automated system will do so at the next trading opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMore advanced approaches may also include the correlations between the different stocks in the portfolio, which can improve tracking error even further.

While there are a number existing academic and industry papers exploring the benefits and drawbacks of direct indexing (see e.g. [4,5,6])\u0026nbsp; it is very challenging to independently verify these findings from the published results. In order to evaluate the performance of our direct indexing implementation for the target index we offer (S\u0026amp;P 500), we elected to run extensive simulations on historical data for S\u0026amp;P 500 constituents going back 20 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eData\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe quality of any simulation is only as good as the underlying data used. We are particularly proud of the considerable efforts taken to produce high-quality simulations and continue to refine our simulations going forward. The dataset used for our simulations come from two sources, first from S\u0026amp;P Global we obtained the historical weighting used by the S\u0026amp;P 500 index on a daily basis going back to 2003. Additionally, we license dividend and split-adjusted daily stock prices from our primary data provider Xignite. Even with high quality data sources there were still dozens of data artifacts (e.g. mergers \u0026amp; acquisitions) and inaccuracies that had to be detected and corrected for, which was done manually by our engineering teams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eHistorical Simulations\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to provide evidence for the performance of direct indexing we consider the results for\u0026nbsp; multiple simulations using overlapping 10 year periods, with starting dates every 90 days, over the period of 12/2003 \u0026#8211; 06/2022. In each of the 36 simulations runs we iterate through time on a weekly basis calling the direct indexing algorithm and simulating the resulting trades.

This latter tax rate represents an investor in the 95-98th percentile tax bracket as is described in the “Investor A” profile of Khang et al. [5].

The reinvestment scenario represents near the best case for direct indexing, assuming that the investor has capital gains each year that can be written off and reinvested in the market immediately. The scenario without reinvestment represents somewhat of the worst case scenario for this time period, where the investor at the end of the period has carried forward $25.5k losses (51% of the initial deposit) the value of these losses can be assessed by the individual familiar with their tax situation. Finally, by leaving out reinvestment we can understand how closely the direct indexing portfolio matches the performance of the target S\u0026amp;P 500 index, in this example the final portfolio value is within 0.3% of target.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eMultiple Simulation Results\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to get a better overall understanding of the performance for direct index we may consider the aggregate results of multiple simulations over different time periods. Here, unfortunately, the data available for backtesting simulations is somewhat limited by the quality and resolutions of historical data. Especially when we consider that direct indexing is a long-term investing strategy and must therefore be evaluated on time periods relevant to the curious investor.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn light of this, we elected to run overlapping simulations on the historical data in an attempt to make the most of what data is available. Specifically, 10 year periods with 90-day staggered starting dates were used for our analysis, for example, the first simulation ran for the period 2003-12-17 to 2013-10-23, the second simulation ran from 2004-03-16 to 2014-01-23, and so on, overall a total of 36 such simulations were conducted. Note, that the results for these simulations are deterministic so multiple simulation runs on the same time period are not required or desirable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs mentioned above, these simulation runs consider only the single $50,000 deposit setting as we feel that this setting provides the most clarity into the performance of direct indexing. In the regular deposit setting individual deposits can have some interaction, e.g. deposits can help fill in underweight positions sooner rather than waiting for a loss harvest opportunity, but these interactions have a relatively insignificant effect on the total losses harvested. As such, one can likely best understand the benefits of a multiple deposit setting by simply adding up the expected benefit of each deposit individually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe primary statistics of interest for direct indexing relate to the question of how much capital loss can one expect to capture, and when in the lifetime of the portfolio can these losses be expected to occur. To answer these questions consider the following figure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-large has-custom-border\"\u003e\u003cimg data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1850\" height=\"1134\" data-attachment-id=\"193\" data-permalink=\"https://freccom.blog/2023/09/15/frec-direct-indexing-algorithm/chart3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chart3.jpg?fit=1850%2C1134\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1850,1134\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;1\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"chart3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chart3.jpg?fit=300%2C184\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chart3.jpg?fit=1024%2C628\u0026amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chart3.jpg?resize=1850%2C1134\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-193\" style=\"border-width:1px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"\u003eAverage harvested losses in each year following the initial deposit as a percentage of the deposit, error bars are shown at two standard deviations\u003csup data-fn=\"4b13729c-67ab-4a6e-841c-af34c309b736\" class=\"fn\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#4b13729c-67ab-4a6e-841c-af34c309b736\" id=\"4b13729c-67ab-4a6e-841c-af34c309b736-link\"\u003e3\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHere the losses are averaged over all 36 simulations for each year following the deposit and plotted above as a percentage of the initial deposit. After 10 years the direct indexing algorithm harvested losses summing to 45% of the initial deposit ($22,567) when reinvesting and 40% ($19,820) without reinvesting losses. Additionally, this data indicates that the large majority of the tax losses harvested occur in the first few years of a deposit, with more than half of the losses occurring within the first 2 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNext we consider the question of how much additional return might be expected from utilizing the direct indexing strategy. To answer this question, simulations where losses are reinvested into the portfolio become necessary simply due to the fact that if the losses harvested from direct indexing are never utilized then no financial benefits can be observed. Recall that for the reinvestment case losses are reinvested quarterly at an assumed tax rate of 42.3%, e.g. if $100 of net losses are harvested in Q1 year 3 at the end of the quarter an additional $42.30 will be deposited into the account and reallocated by the direct indexing algorithm.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-large has-custom-border is-style-default\"\u003e\u003cimg data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1878\" height=\"1112\" data-attachment-id=\"221\" data-permalink=\"https://freccom.blog/2023/09/15/frec-direct-indexing-algorithm/chart4-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chart4-2.jpg?fit=1878%2C1112\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1878,1112\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;1\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"chart4-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chart4-2.jpg?fit=300%2C178\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chart4-2.jpg?fit=1024%2C606\u0026amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/chart4-2.jpg?resize=1878%2C1112\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-221\" style=\"border-width:1px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"\u003eAverage excess return (portfolio value \u0026#8211; benchmark value) as a percentage of the initial deposit, error bars are shown at two standard deviations\u003csup\u003e3\u003c/sup\u003e.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe above figure shows the excess returns as a percentage of the initial deposit relative to the benchmark (SPY ETF) averaged over all 36 simulation runs with and without reinvestment.

Additionally, these harvested losses tend to occur relatively soon after the deposit is made, which is expected since the cost basis of the purchased assets are most similar to their market prices immediately after purchase. Any small drop in prices will therefore lead to an opportunity to harvest losses, leading to a secondary effect: the repurchase of more stocks at their new cost basis.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile it’s generally a good thing that the benefits occur early, so that they may be realized and reinvested sooner, one can also make the observation that the benefits of direct indexing diminish over time. Again, this generally makes sense as we expect the assets in our portfolio to grow over time away from their cost basis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have any questions about the details, feel free to reach out at \u003ca href=\"mailto:help@frec.com\"\u003ehelp@frec.com\u003c/a\u003e or schedule a call \u003ca href=\"https://calendly.com/frecteam/introductory-call-frec\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003chr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eReferences\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp class=\"has-x-small-font-size\"\u003e[1] Markowitz, H.: Portfolio Selection.

If any of these tax lots are trading below their cost basis, by a set threshold, then the lot is sold, the loss realized, and the proceeds are invested into a similar ETF. Provided, of course, that no wash sales are triggered by this trading action. Harvesting can occur between pairs of ETFs or larger sets (or even sets-of-sets) and can include other special considerations such as avoiding wash sale interaction with IRA accounts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSwapping between similar ETFs does raise the question of how one can determine whether two similar ETFs are “substantially identical” for the purposes of satisfying wash sale rules. In this report, however, we simplify this issue by assuming a favorable assumption for the ETF-based harvesting approach: that a perfect substitute ETF may be swapped without “substantially identical” implications. Specifically, as we are interested in the S\u0026amp;P 500 index as a baseline, the ETFs used are \u003cstrong\u003eSPY \u003c/strong\u003eand\u003cstrong\u003e IVV\u003c/strong\u003e, both of which track this index and have sufficient historical data for the last 20 years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe ETF-based algorithm implemented for this report is a simple one. Prices and lot cost basis values are monitored weekly, if a tax lot has fallen below a threshold value of 3% it will be sold to harvest a loss (respecting the 30-day wash sale window). Also, if there are no tax implications as a tie-breaker, the algorithm will prefer to hold the lower-fee ETF (IVV) with an expense ratio of 0.03%. Importantly, this algorithm is used for comparison purposes only and it is not claimed to simulate the performance as the algorithms used by popular robo-advisors or any other platform. For detailed information on more advanced tax loss harvesting with ETFs, and the many related considerations, we recommend reviewing the \u003ca href=\"https://www.betterment.com/resources/tax-loss-harvesting-methodology\"\u003eTax Loss Harvesting+\u003c/a\u003e white paper published by Betterment [2].\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eInsights from Backtesting Tax Loss Harvesting with Direct Indexing vs. an ETF-to-ETF Strategy\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe evaluate the performance of the ETF-based TLH approach in contrast with direct indexing over multiple historical backtesting simulations, following standard experimental methodology (e.g. Moehle et al. [4]). Specifically simulations were conducted on overlapping 10 year periods, with starting dates every 90 days, using historical data spanning the period 12/17/2003 to 07/25/2023\u003csup data-fn=\"d025f19f-8cbe-41f6-9bdf-70dffc95729c\" class=\"fn\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#d025f19f-8cbe-41f6-9bdf-70dffc95729c\" id=\"d025f19f-8cbe-41f6-9bdf-70dffc95729c-link\"\u003e2\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn each of the 40 simulations runs algorithms are executed on a weekly basis and the resulting trade actions are simulated using closing prices on the same day. Here we consider the scenario where there is a \u003cstrong\u003eone-time deposit of $50,000\u003c/strong\u003e at the beginning of the simulation period. While TLH does generally does work best when regular deposits are used, the performance implications of each of these independent deposits can really be considered in isolation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eImportantly, two simulations were conducted for each approach, the first simulation does not assume any of the tax losses harvested are reinvested into the portfolio, while the second assumes that any tax losses can be yield tax savings as cash and are reinvested quarterly, an assumed tax rate of 42.3% is used. This tax rate represents an investor in the 95-98th percentile tax bracket as is described in the “Investor A” profile of Khang et al. [3]. These two scenarios (with and without reinvestment) represent somewhat of a best-case and worst-case scenario when it comes to the investor’s ability to utilize tax losses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eData licensed from S\u0026amp;P Global and Xignite\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe quality of any simulation is only as good as the underlying data used. We are particularly proud of the considerable efforts taken to produce high-quality simulations and continue to refine our simulations going forward. The dataset used for our simulations come from two sources, first from S\u0026amp;P Global we obtained the historical weighting used by the S\u0026amp;P 500 index on a daily basis going back to 2003. Additionally, we license dividend and split-adjusted daily stock prices from our primary data provider Xignite. Even with high quality data sources there were still dozens of data artifacts (e.g. mergers \u0026amp; acquisitions) and inaccuracies that had to be detected and corrected for, which was done manually by our engineering teams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eResults\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor each of the 40 simulation periods 4 separate TLH simulations were performed, ETF-based with and without reinvestment, and Direct Indexing with and without reinvestment. All simulations assume only a single deposit, of $50,000, initiated on day 1.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to develop an understanding of the experimental setup let’s consider an example, specifically the very first simulation run from 12/17/2003 to 12/14/2013 with no reinvestment of harvested losses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-large has-custom-border\"\u003e\u003cimg data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2634\" height=\"1332\" data-attachment-id=\"319\" data-permalink=\"https://freccom.blog/2023/09/08/tax-loss-harvesting-etf-based-v-s-direct-indexing/portfolio-value-time-series-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/portfolio-value-time-series-1.jpg?fit=2634%2C1332\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"2634,1332\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;1\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"portfolio-value-time-series-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/portfolio-value-time-series-1.jpg?fit=300%2C152\u0026amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/portfolio-value-time-series-1.jpg?fit=1024%2C518\u0026amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/freccom.blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/portfolio-value-time-series-1.jpg?resize=2634%2C1332\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-319\" style=\"border-width:1px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"\u003ePortfolio value for the Direct Indexing (neon) and ETF-based (beige) algorithms for the no-reinvestment setting are shown relative to the baseline SPY ETF.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe above figure illustrates the difference between the portfolio values for the Direct Indexing algorithm as well as the ETF-based algorithm in contrast to the SPY ETF. Considering that none of the tax losses are reinvested into the index it’s not surprising to see that the portfolios track the performance of the baseline (SPY) very closely. Both the TLH approaches slightly out-perform SPY, which is likely due to a mixture of variance and reduced fees.

Here we can see the “all-or-none” loss-harvesting behavior for the ETF-based algorithm in contrast to the Direct Indexing approach in the first 4 years of simulation. Specifically, there are no losses harvested until the ETF drops below the 2003 cost basis during the market downturn in the 2008 financial crisis\u003csup data-fn=\"eb77b464-d711-4b6a-ae7d-ce8f8f49e688\" class=\"fn\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#eb77b464-d711-4b6a-ae7d-ce8f8f49e688\" id=\"eb77b464-d711-4b6a-ae7d-ce8f8f49e688-link\"\u003e3\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e. The Direct Indexing approach, on the other hand, is able to harvest losses from some of the constituents throughout the simulation period. Overall on this single simulation we can see that the Direct Indexing approach harvests losses at approximately a 2.4x higher rate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe next consider how reinvesting the harvested losses quarterly at an assumed tax rate of 42.3% would affect the portfolio value over time.

Here we can see that the low-cost ETF IVV, expense ratio of 0.03%, slightly out-performs the SPY ETF having an expense ratio of 0.09%. However, these relatively modest improvements are significantly out-paced by the tax loss harvesting algorithms as tax savings are reinvested. In these simulations the average excess return for Direct Indexing was 45.3%, average excess CAGR (alpha) of 1.87%, while the ETF-based approach had an average excess return of 17.3%, average excess CAGR of 0.84%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eDirect Indexing or ETF-based, Which Strategy Outperforms with Tax Loss Harvesting?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHistorical backtesting simulations indicate quite conclusively that Direct Indexing can out-perform ETF-based tax loss harvesting by a factor of 1.9x \u0026#8211; 2.1x depending on the investor’s ability to reinvest tax savings. Additionally, simulation results suggests that the Direct Indexing approach can allow more tax-efficient withdrawals from the account, which can be a significant factor when management fees are applied. When contrasting the 0.1% fee offered by Frec Direct Indexing with the higher 0.25% fee charged by many popular robo-advisors these advantages may add up to a significantly higher portfolio value over time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003chr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003eReferences\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp class=\"has-x-small-font-size\"\u003e[1] Direct Indexing White Paper, Frec Inc. \u003ca href=\"https://frec.com/resources/blog/frec-direct-indexing-algorithm\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://frec.com/resources/blog/frec-direct-indexing-algorithm\u003c/a\u003e, Accessed 17 Oct. 2023.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp class=\"has-x-small-font-size\"\u003e[2] Tax Loss Harvesting+ Methodology, Boris Khentov, Jun. 27, 2023, \u003ca href=\"https://www.betterment.com/resources/tax-loss-harvesting-methodology\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.betterment.com/resources/tax-loss-harvesting-methodology\u003c/a\u003e, Accessed 17 Oct. 2023.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp class=\"has-x-small-font-size\"\u003e[3] Khang, Kevin and Cummings, Alan and Paradise, Thomas, and O’Connor, Brennan, Personalized Indexing: A Portfolio Construction Plan, (March 2022), \u003ca href=\"https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/dam/corp/research/pdf/personalized_indexing_a_portfolio_construction_plan.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://corporate.vanguard.com/content/dam/corp/research/pdf/personalized_indexing_a_portfolio_construction_plan.pdf\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp class=\"has-x-small-font-size\"\u003e[4] Moehle, N., Kochenderfer, M.J., Boyd, S.\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003eet al.\u003c/em\u003e\u0026nbsp;Tax-Aware Portfolio Construction via Convex Optimization.\u0026nbsp;\u003cem\u003eJ Optim Theory Appl\u003c/em\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003e189\u003c/strong\u003e, 364–383 (2021). \u003ca href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10957-021-01823-0\"\u003ehttps://doi.org/10.1007/s10957-021-01823-0\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col class=\"wp-block-list\"\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp class=\"has-x-small-font-size\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis white paper describes implementation and performance details of a Direct Indexing approach similar to that used on the Frec platform at the time of writing (10/17/2023) details may differ from the implementation used in the product now and in future\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp class=\"has-x-small-font-size\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis white paper is for information purposes only and is not intended as tax advice.
