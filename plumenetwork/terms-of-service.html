INTRODUCTION </strong></h3><p>Plume Foundation, a Cayman Island company (“<strong>Plume</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”, or “<strong>our</strong>”) provides this website-hosted user interface (the “<strong>Interface</strong>”) that may be used for accessing Plume Network, a modular Layer 2 blockchain optimized for real world assets (the “<strong>Protocol</strong>”), including our website located at https://<a href="http://www.plumenetwork.xyz/">www.plumenetwork.xyz/</a> as well as any other media form, media channel, or mobile website related, linked, or otherwise connected thereto, and any other website operated on which these Terms of Service (as amended from time to time, these “<strong>Terms</strong>”) are posted (collectively, the “<strong>Site</strong>”) and through our related technologies (collectively, the Interface and the Site, including all existing and any updated or new features, functionality, and technology, our “<strong>Services</strong>”). </p><p>Please read these terms carefully and keep a copy for your reference. Note, there may be specific terms or conditions applicable to you as a user in a given jurisdiction, as detailed below.

CALIFORNIA USERS AND RESIDENTS</h3><p>If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or releasing party.” If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you hereby waive any comparable statute or doctrine. If any complaint with us is not satisfactorily resolved, you can contact the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112, Sacramento, California 95834 or by telephone at (800) 952-5210 or (916) 445-1254.</p><p>‍</p><h3><strong>9.</strong> <strong>ENTIRE AGREEMENT AND SEVERABILITY</strong></h3><p>These Terms (together with the terms incorporated by reference herein) constitute the entire agreement between you and Plume governing your access and use of our Services and supersedes any and all prior discussions, agreements, and understandings of any kind (including without limitation any prior versions of these Terms), between you and Plume. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use Third-Party Services, third-party content, or third-party software. </p><p>If any provision of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable under any rule, law, or regulation of any local, state, or federal government agency, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of the provision to the greatest extent possible under any applicable law and the validity or enforceability of any other provision of these Terms shall not be affected.</p><h3>‍</h3><h3><strong>10.

If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms remain in full force and effect. </p><p>Note, a printed version of these Terms and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. </p><p>‍</p><h3><strong>11. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</strong></h3><p><strong>Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Plume and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us. No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration provision. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial.</strong></p><p>You and Plume agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms (or our Services) is personal to you and Plume and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action, or any other type of representative proceeding.</p><p>You waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of or related to these Terms and our Services, including claims related to privacy and data security resolved in court.

The seat of the arbitration shall be the Cayman Islands. The Tribunal shall consist of one (1) arbitrator, appointed by Plume. The language of the arbitration shall be English.</p><p>‍</p><h3><strong>12.

MISCELLANEOUS</strong></h3><p>The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.</p><p>As used in these Terms, the words “include” and “including,” and variations thereof, will not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.”</p><p>Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail.
