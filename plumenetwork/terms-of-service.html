These Terms were last revised as indicated at the top of this page. You may read a current, effective copy of these Terms by visiting the âTerms of Serviceâ link on the Site. Further, you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change and it is solely your responsibility to periodically review these Terms to stay informed of updates. You will be subject to and will be deemed to have been aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Terms by your continued use of our Services after the date such revised Terms are posted.
