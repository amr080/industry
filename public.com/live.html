For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude treasury securities held in treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “ Treasury Accounts” section.<br/><br/>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors. The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa. Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk. All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change. Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond&#x27;s credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned. Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.<br/><br/><em>A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond. Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our<!-- --> <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/fee-schedule" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Fee Schedule</a></em>. <br/><br/><em>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account. The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</em><br/><br/>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages.

JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity). T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.” Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash. The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity. T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk. As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates. Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment.

I'm your host Kinsey Grant and today's show is brought to you by Tema ETFs and joining us as today's guest is Chris Seminec. He's an investor partner at Tema ETFs, and they're an issuer focused on bottom-up investing in unique structural themes like the one that I'm sure we will talk about today in this conversation. The RSHO ETF, that's the ticker R-S-H-O, excuse me, is one that we're gonna talk a lot about today because we are talking about reshoring, which is a really interesting practice that is certainly derived from a lot of macroeconomic and geopolitical realities that we're facing today and is something that is certainly an interesting force in the economy and in the investing world. So Chris, welcome to the Public Podcast. I'm excited to talk about this with you today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChris Semenuk: \u003c/strong\u003eHi, Kinsey. Thanks for having me on.\\\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eOf course, of course. So I want to start here with some big-picture stuff. When we think about bringing more jobs to the United States or bolstering the economy, the domestic economy, it seems like a relatively simple thing to do in theory. But you and I both know that in practice, it's likely much more complicated than just bringing more jobs here and bolstering the economy. Especially in the light of the last few years, we had what I think many of us would kind of consider a supply chain breakdown in 2020, shortly after the onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic. We've been seeing this transition from more international supply chains to more domestic ones. But I would love to hear a little bit in the big picture about how you would define this reality, this part of the economy, the global economy that might be focused on this practice of reshoring. Tell me a little bit about what reshoring is and how we see those forces at play right now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCS: \u003c/strong\u003eGreat. So reshoring, when you read about it in the newspapers, I think can be defined most simply as just companies that are locating or bringing production from overseas back to the shores of the United States. But I think it's really important for investors to step back for a minute because what that is, is the result of, you know, reshoring is a result of a process that has started a few years ago, a few years back, which is essentially that companies are number one unwinding a lot of the unintended exposures that resulted from essentially 20 or 30 years of globalization. What I mean by these sort of exposures are when they located production from shores of the US to overseas to take advantage of low-cost labor, they ended up incurring that resulted from essentially 20 or 30 years of globalization. And what I mean by these sort of exposures are, when they located production from shores of the US to overseas to take advantage of low-cost labor, they ended up incurring or ended up getting exposed to certain vulnerabilities and certain exposures by having their production located or ended up getting exposed to certain vulnerabilities and certain exposures by having their production located five, six thousand miles away. So reshoring is, I think, a response or, as I said, an unwinding of those vulnerabilities or unintended consequences of globalization. Now there are two other trends going on at the same time, and one of them is that during this time of globalization, which really started back during 2000, which was when China entered WTO. Over that 20 years of globalization, that search for low-cost labor, I think companies in the US neglected their manufacturing base here in the US. And I think we're now finding out that companies are aware of that primarily because of what happened during the pandemic and also what happened as it relates to a number of the global to a number of the global conflicts and wars that have taken place in recent years. So reshoring is a trend that's been in place, I think, for years, even though a lot of people assume it was a response to the pandemic or to global conflict. Now there's a third underlying trend and conflicts and wars that have taken place in recent years. So reshoring is a trend that's been in place, I think, for years, even though a lot of people assume it was a response to the pandemic or to global conflict. Now there's a third underlying trend, and that is that the US government is now spending or is now writing a check that represents the largest value in terms of industrial policy in history. And what the government is trying to do is, in my mind, essentially crowd in private investment here in the U.S. to essentially address that neglected industrial manufacturing infrastructure that was sort of left behind over the last 20 years as U.S. corporates looked outside the shores of the U.S. for production is in my mind essentially crowd in private investment here in the US to essentially address that neglected industrial manufacturing structure that was sort of left behind over the last 20 years as US corporates looked outside of the shores of the US for production.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, that certainly makes a lot of sense, and I appreciate the context especially to illustrate that this is not something that is just a post-2020 reality, right? That reshoring and globalization been forces that have been at play for quite some time. Now, before we get into some of those, the kind of next phase of what comes after this reshoring trend here, I would love to talk a little bit about the vulnerabilities of globalization that you mentioned. What might some of those vulnerabilities be? And in what case and at what point might those vulnerabilities be encourage a company to engage in some reshoring to bring production or to bring industry back to the United States? Tell me a little bit about how that plays out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCS: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so I think a lot of investors conflate reshoring as a company's defensive move as it relates to events that have essentially highlighted the vulnerabilities and exposures that have resulted from globalization. So there are indeed cases where companies or manufacturers are moving production or parts of production back to the US as a sort of defensive measure. That said, though, there are also examples of companies that are taking an offensive approach to reshoring. And so it's not just manufacturing. It can be a retailer, for example, that wants to locate some of its production here in the US. And they see it as an offensive measure, meaning you're closer to your customers, your design is closer to your manufacturing. And when those two factors are in place, you can have quicker product cycles, but also more product cycles. And ultimately that just results in more growth. So reshoring is not only defensive, but it's also an offensive move for companies. But broadly speaking, we're taking a very active approach to the theme. And I think that's really important for investors to keep in mind. Reshoring is not a one size fits all positive on every company that does it. And as I said, it's both defensive and offensive. Not only that, but reshoring is not only the company, the reshoring opportunity is not only companies that are moving manufacturing, but it's companies that are supplying to those people, to those companies and companies that are support services to those companies as well. And I think it's really in those areas, not, you know, it's not just about the caterpillars or the large manufacturers that you read about in the headlines of the newspapers every day it's actually about the more smaller medium-cap businesses that are kind of being pulled along with those manufacturers who are going to have to set up supply chains, support services here in the US that they didn't have before, and that's going to create underlying demand for businesses that I think a lot of people don't necessarily think about, and it's why we started the fund because we think those are opportunities we want to get in that are kind of being pulled along with those manufacturers who are going to have to set up supply chains, support services here in the US that he didn't have before. And that's gonna create underlying demand for businesses that I think a lot of people don't necessarily think about. And it's why we started the fund because we think those are opportunities we wanna give.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eIt's also the orders of magnitude of like impact that they have on all sorts of other companies and businesses and even investing themes as well. Now, one thing that I do want to get your perspective on before we dig in more to the ETF, because I am interested to hear more about how that works and you know what you're doing over there. One thing is this idea of the balancing act that companies are always continuously having to engage in. When we're talking about reshoring specifically or globalization, even more broadly,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCS: \u003c/strong\u003eWe're talking about corporations that have to think about the timeline of their product cycles. They also have to think about labor costs. They also have to think about economic headwinds and all sorts of impacts in the economy, globally speaking. But they also do have to consider geopolitical tensions. You mentioned that there are companies that are engaging in reshoring as both offense and defense. But I am curious about how geopolitical tensions, especially with China, might impact American companies making a decision to engage in restoring.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eThis is something that has always kind of been heating up, it's always what people use those two words to describe tensions between the United States and China. But we saw that China is taking all their pandas back from the rest of the world. They were seeing some headlines now. So I'm curious to hear your perspective on how that plays into this larger conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCS: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so again, I think a lot of investors and people that sort of watch this space sort of immediately link this as a kind of US versus China issue. As I said, it's not really that. It's really an unwinding of some unintended negative consequences of globalization. Look, it took 20 years for us to kind of get into this situation. It'll take us decades to kind of unwind some of these unwanted practices. You're right. I mean, at the moment, or at least if you look back since China entered WTO, it's been pretty much a bipolar manufacturing world. We've had the US on one side and we've had China on the other. And I think what we're witnessing now is in some ways, a kind of effort by both sides to sort of reduce this sort of economic interdependence on one another. And I think Jake Sullivan, who has been very vocal as part of the current administration, now is in some ways. It's interesting that the administration puts the National Security Advisor in front of the public when talking about American manufacturing and his whole sort of focus is initially on critical areas or areas of say national security. So that's why the first wave of reshoring focused on EV batteries, on semiconductors, on pharmaceuticals. As I said, from an investment opportunity standpoint, there are opportunities there. Those companies that make those products are kind of making the reshoring journey. But beyond that, as I said, there's a whole world of the kind of picks and shovels, if you will, that people will need to use. And I think those picks and shovels will be enormous investment opportunities that I think, again, can only be uncovered using an active process. But as I said, we're moving from this sort of bipolar manufacturing world to a multipolar world. And I think that multipolar world involves not only sort of Mexico, but it involves companies moving out of China into and around the regions of China, India, Mexico, Bangladesh. But broadly speaking, you know, the fund is focused on businesses that are relocating manufacturing back to the US. We do own some foreign companies. In the cases there are companies like ABB, the Swiss company that makes a lot of electrical utility equipment. They have specifically said that they want to take advantage of the spending that the US government is putting in place in these incentives. So they are actually, in terms of their total capital investment, increasing it the most in the US in terms of their manufacturing footprint. f their total capital investment increasing at the most in the US in terms of manufacturing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eMakes sense, yeah. I think within the idea of this as an investment opportunity, which is something we've kind of touched on a little bit here, I would love to hear more about the $RSHO ETF. You mentioned that it's investing in companies that are engaging in reshoring. But tell me a little bit about the premise beyond that and how it might fit into investors' portfolios, especially those who might be listening today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCS: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so investors should see the American Reshoring Fund as, well, what it is, is about 31 companies. And the common thread that runs through every one of these companies is that they are, as we define, high quality. So high quality for us means business that generates net-free cash flow throughout the business cycle and is able to use that free cash flow and reinvest it at competitive rates of return. And then also what they don't use, pay it back to shareholders who buybacks and dividends. So if you strip away the reshoring theme of the fund, what an investor is essentially left with is, as I said, a collection of very high quality cashflow generating businesses. And when you layer on the reshoring theme, these businesses are essentially getting a tailwind of demand that we think will last at least, as I said, it took more than a couple of decades for us to kind of get into this predicament where we have vulnerable supply chains, it'll take at least a couple of decades to get out. And as a result, we think this is a very durable investment theme that we think will play out over years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eRight. And for investors who are listening to this, can you explain the relevance of this idea of durability in a portfolio, especially for people who are interested in buying and holding?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCS: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so these, as I said, these are businesses that have shown a propensity to create shareholder value historically. So I think it's really important for investors when they think about the theme, as I said, it fits into a core equity strategy. These are just simply very high quality, in some cases, manufacturing businesses, in some cases, service companies that I think an investor would look at anyway. And as I said, what we've tried to do is say, okay, we've got this collection of high quality businesses that generate free cash, that generate competitive ROIC. Where are we in this portfolio in terms of businesses that intersect with this secular tailwind of demand that, as I said, I think will last years in the making? So, you know, again, the American manufacturing footprint used to be regarded as sort of the leader in the world. you know, back in the sort of 70s. And, you know, we relinquished that during the period of globalization. But I think the administration, the government, is in support of kind of rebuilding the American infrastructure. They're putting money behind it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eCompanies recognize the benefits of it. And the durability of the trend, I think, will be at least a couple of decades in the making. Okay. And how has this reinvestment in American manufacturing panned out? I mean, obviously this idea of, this is a long-term conversation, it's years in the making, but so far, how's it been?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCS: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so the fund launched in May and performance has been excellent. I think what we're seeing is that the businesses in the portfolio, as I said, are very high quality in nature in terms of their ability to generate free cash and invest at a high ROIC. Now, what's happened is that post the pandemic, when we've had customers and customers of the manufacturing complex. ordering two and three times what they thought they would get because we had supply chain shortages. A lot of the companies that we own in the portfolio that are manufacturing related didn't hire headcount to address that. So, as I said, as we kind of move forward going through this economic uncertain period that we're moving into with high interest rates and threat of recession, all of the companies in the portfolio are still running very lean because they didn't over hire back in sort of 21 as we exited the pandemic. So I think as and when this sort of recovery starts to pick up again in 2024, the businesses in the fund that we're invested in, I think, stand to actually over earn going forward as their revenues start to regrow again. And keep in mind that at the moment, many of the companies in the portfolio right now have backlogs that are almost double and triple what they were before they went into the pandemic. And these backlogs are still, you know, I think stand to actually over earn going forward as their revenues start to regrow again. And they keep it double and triple what they were before they went into the pandemic. And these backlogs are still, you know, too excellent what they were and are taking some time to work off. So the fact is, even if we go into a recession, these backlogs may allow these companies to continue to grow straight through a recession and then come out the air of the sun and continue growing as the economy eventually improves. So the fact is, even if we go into a recession, these backlogs may allow these companies to continue to grow straight through a recession and then come out the other side and continue with growing as the economy eventually improves again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eMakes sense to me.

And he's there in iShares investment strategy team. Also joining us today, we have Faye Witherall, who delivers thought leadership on the broad market and economic outlook also at iShares. Nick and Faye, welcome. to the public podcast. It's great to have you both on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Morales:\u003c/strong\u003e Thank you so much, Ann. Pleasure to be here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB:\u003c/strong\u003e Let's start with some research, Faye and Nick, that you and your team have been releasing to the market late last month. iShares released the 2023 mid-year outlook, the half-time report, and it mentions that for the first half of 2023 it's been quote characterized by opposing narratives. So I'm excited to jump right in and get to the heart of what exactly does that mean? What are those two opposing narratives that you have been focused on?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNM:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, so what we've really been focused on, and I think the market at large has too, is this idea of whether or not we're actually going to be in a recession at this moment or whether or not we're going to have this soft landing. So that's when you hear on all the headlines and all the talk radio shows and the like, when we hear soft versus hard landing, it's whether or not we're in a recession or not. So our contention is whether or not we're in a recession is really going to come down to semantics at the end of the day. really matters for the time being is that the Federal Reserve is going to keep holding rates a bit higher for a bit longer. And this is because the battle against inflation isn't really over quite yet. Though we did get a really good inflationary disinflationary print last week on Wednesday, where it came over to point 2% month over month, we like to look at that month-over-month number, still doesn't mean we're quite out of the woods yet. So we think the Federal Reserve will hold rates where they're at, maybe hike another time. but for the most part, they're gonna hold them there until probably March of 2024. So in that sort of context, it means that we have a preference for fixed income at the moment. We think that the front end of the curve looks really attractive right now. So there's some really good opportunities for investors overall, but when it comes to the underlying economic backdrop, the hard and soft landing, both of those camps are still definitely competing and there is varied data. So we're a bit uncertain of where that kind works itself out. But in the time being, there's some great opportunities in fixed income that we can talk more about.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB:\u003c/strong\u003e So, Faye and Nick, that you've brought up a lot there, let's just unpack some of the terminology. Let's talk about what you mean by a soft landing. It's one of those terms that's being bandied around a lot because it seems to be increasingly likely, but no one's really defining it. So, Faye or Nick, help us understand exactly what you mean by that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFaye Witherall:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, so this has been a very topical term, as you mentioned. We've heard this a lot over the past few months. So a soft landing is the goal of a central bank when it lowers inflation to an acceptable rate without leading to a severe economic downturn or a large increase in unemployment. So we can just back up for some context. The Federal Reserve's delivered 10 consecutive interest rate hikes over the last 15 months, paused only in June in this attempt to really tame surging inflation. So typically, when interest rates rise, we see a reduction in economic activity, and borrowing costs increase. So in essence, the Fed is maneuvering the plane. It's using monetary policy to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eRight.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFW: \u003c/strong\u003eTrying to touch the runway without any breaks or hiccups. That's your soft landing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB\u003c/strong\u003e: So, and it just is sort of really unpacked that using some numbers. One definition of a recession is one of several, and it's not the only one. It's not the only factor that is technically two consecutive quarters of GDP decline. Am I hearing that soft landing can mean no growth or very slow growth, but certainly not decline. So again, just in terms of numbers, soft landing is 0% growth or more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNM: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, the way I would go and think about it there is that we have what we call the real growth of the United States. That's GDP growth. It's our potential at the end of the day, which is around that 2% number. We know that we're going to be coming in below that. And whether or not you're in a recession is whether you come in below that and also dip below that 0%. So you're contracting on a GDP basis. And I think no matter what, we're gonna be below that 2% number, kind of like our potential as an economy, but whether or not we dip into that negative territory, we'll see. And right now, what we're really seeing in the market is kind of these pockets in which we are seeing that negative growth, but then there's other pockets that are really strong. So, for instance, in manufacturing right now, we're definitely looking at recessionary territory. Industrial production is really low, and capex spend is really low. But then you look towards the US consumer. You have real income rising. You have low unemployment. So that part of the economy, which to be fair, represents around 70% of US GDP, still remains really strong. So you can definitely be in a recessionary environment in different pockets of the economy, while other parts are still remaining strong. And that's really the mixed data that macroeconomists are kind of grappling with at the moment. That's why there's so much divergence in whether or not we'll be soft landing or hard landing, what the actual... impacts of tighter monetary policy are, because it's showing up really differently in different parts of the economy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah. And Nick, thank you for that breakdown, because one of the things we love to do here for the public community is really unpack. What does the jargon mean? Let's take some of these terms, let's demystify them so that we can help folks make better investing decisions. And it's a great segue to going back to how you open the show, Nick, who said that you guys believe that there are some great opportunities out there in, quote, high quality, fixed income. So tell us where you're seeing some attractive debt out there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNM: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so if they can go and speak to this. Overall, when we go and talk about what we mean by high quality fixed income is, again, with the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, there's really good opportunity and that yields are higher. And they're at a point where we haven't seen them in 10, 15 years. But we do still have preference for that higher quality fixed income. That's because, again, The economic backdrop is a bit more muddled at the moment. So I'll let Faye speak a bit more to that though.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFW: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, just to add some color, maybe some numbers to what Nick was saying, if you consider that you're holding this one-year Treasury bill today for a full year, you're looking at a return of more than 5%. And compared to the last 10 years, that looks a lot closer to 1% when interest rates were extremely low. So as Nick mentioned, we're not expecting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this year, and instead will be in this higher for longer environment for the immediate future. So in short, this really means first, that investors looking for income can now do so in these really high quality portions of the bond market. And this is something that we haven't seen in a really, really long time. And second, that bonds can now act as a diversification for portfolios as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eFaye, let's talk a little bit more about that and how in practice, retail investors can go get the benefit of some of those yield levels and the income we've talked about. On the one hand, we know that folks can go by treasuries. We know that you can do that for the public platform, for example. But in terms of corporate credit, unpack for us how someone with a public account can go invest in that asset class.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFW: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so when we're talking about fixed income, it's really important for investors also to consider kind of the credit worthiness of the bonds that they hold. So riskier fixed income reflects higher yields, but the reason for that premium is due to the perceived risk that, you know, there's a smaller chance of being paid back, also known as defaulting. So we're constructive, as Nick mentioned, on high quality exposures, which is typically less volatile than those high yield counterparts. And these are called investment grade exposures. So we're leaning into the investment grade side of the fixed income market versus the more risky high yield exposures.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd how does the retail investor get exposure to that? Are there ETFs out there that you're watching? Are there specific direct purchases that's a little bit harder to execute on? How exactly can the public investor get their money into these assets?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNM: \u003c/strong\u003eThis is a great question, Ann, because one of the ways in which the bond market is sort of set up, and historically it's been this way, is that you most literally have to call your broker-dealer to buy a particular issuance or something along those lines. But with the advent of, like you said, ETFs, is that we can go and take all those bonds, we can put them in an easily accessible wrapper. public.com for instance and they can go and buy a bond ETF. And what that allows is an instant single line item in which you go and get diversification and you get access to all the cash flows associated with the underlying bonds themselves. So it's really a revolutionary way in which investors have access to the bond market in a fashion that they really didn't even 5, 10, 15 years ago. So when we talk about ways to go and access it, ETFs are our primary tool investors can use. You can trade them on exchange during market hours. And it's really easy for investors, rather than going to a website that looks like it was designed in the 1970s to buy treasury bonds. You can go to public.com and actually get access to those through ETFs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFW: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and there's a large variety too, like Nick was mentioning. We have investment grade ETFs, treasury ETFs. So there's a lot of choices for investors depending on where they're trying to park their money.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eLet's talk a little bit about how an investor may have a different profile. Depending on income level right now, your report, I'm just looking at it right now, mentions that saving rates have fallen, especially for lower income households. Conversely, the labor market remains strong, depending on which numbers you read, there's somewhere between 10 million and a net 4.4 million of, quote, excess jobs or open jobs out there, depending on how you define these things. How does that translate this declining? household savings rate yet a strong wage rate environment. How does that translate into opportunities for equity investors right now?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNM: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, this is a great question because one of the things that we're seeing is this U.S. consumer that has been very resilient over the past six months to a year. And so when we go and talk about the savings rate, the reason this matters is because at the end of the day, we had a really high savings glut over the COVID era, and that's been slowly spent down. Over that same time, if many people know, is that the labor market's been relatively tight. That means people could switch jobs and people could look for higher wages elsewhere. So those two combinations mean that the U.S. consumer effectively had a lot of extra cash to go and spend. They could spend down their savings while also either moving jobs or looking for higher pay elsewhere. And as a result, we get the environment which we have now in which the US consumer remains in a fairly robust place. Going forward, however, we think that kind of maybe that sort of works itself out and we get back to trend. And in that type of environment, that's where we wanna lean into what we like to call the quality factor. And this is for two reasons. It's because first of all, with the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates, there's a higher cost of capital, costs a lot more for businesses to go and borrow. And in that type of environment, a lot of small companies and their business models start to come under pressure in that world. Also, when you have a slowing US consumer and their ability to spend is not gonna be as much as it was six months ago, that continues to go and put pressure on many of those companies. Means that the inventories that they had may not get sold and will have to start discounting things. It means that their top line, their revenue growth won't be as strong on a year over year basis. So what we really talk about in terms of the opportunities out there, It's leaning into what we call quality, like I said. These are companies with strong balance sheets, really strong free cash flows, who have strong return on equities, and they can continue to go and pass back also a lot of their profits back to shareholders via dividends. So when we talk about quality, that's really what we mean. That's the opportunity out there. And as it relates to where the U.S. consumer is, where those savings rates are, and where the underlying economy is kind of working itself out in the back half of the year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eIt's interesting Nick and Faye to hear you describe the pockets you're looking at because this idea of quality is core to both your thesis on the fixed income side, Fay specifically said you're focused on investment grade, which is the lower risk, higher free cash flow, stronger balance sheet company typically that gets investment grade ratings. Nick, you're looking for the same thing on the equity side and that profile often translates into dividends. So let's talk about valuation. in that context, right? We've seen this rally in the S\u0026amp;P to highs not seen since before the Fed started to hike rates in 2022. We've seen NASDAQ, which got absolutely beaten down and drumming down last year, have a roaring return this year. So what does that mean, guys? Does that mean you're saying stay away from... growth equities right now to hunker down into dividend yielding equities and investment grade or are you saying something else about portfolio construction?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNM: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so the way it actually kind of works itself out is when you go and apply this quality factor especially to the S\u0026amp;P 500 for instance, no matter what you actually go and get this overweight towards those mega cap tech companies such as Apple and Microsoft. And the reason being, makes perfect sense, they are the most profitable companies in the United States. So when we go and look towards that quality factor, it does go and give us that mega cap tech overweight no matter what, but it also goes and gives us exposure to other pockets of the market that continue to also exhibit those same characteristics. It means we're avoiding right now, again, those small caps, those companies whose business models are gonna come under pressure, especially with a higher cost of capital. With that said, there's also a lot of those tech companies that are unprofitable. those companies are reevaluating. They're looking towards profitability, but they're not quite there yet. We think they continue to come under pressure. So if we look at one of the most rewarded factors year to date, it is profitability, and we think that will continue to go and be the case for the back half of the year. So there are opportunities out there. It's not just looking away from those mega cap tech companies and towards what often people say is, the less exciting parts of the market. We still think there are really great opportunities out there. They're just not gonna be in maybe those unprofitable tech names that many people like to invest in, or that are a bit more exciting on a day-to-day basis because of the volatility around them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eNick, what are some other pockets that you're seeing the quality factor apply to? And I think about some sectors in that muddy, I think it's the word you use, Nicholas, uncertain environment have tended to fare quite well. It's been the likes of healthcare, pharmaceuticals with relatively predictable flow of cash, at least from those drugs, which they've had on patent for a long time, or they've got established distribution. We've often seen it in certain financials. You saw J.P. Morgan had a rip roaring earnings report. You know Goldman a little bit weaker today, but by and large the financials post the regional bank crisis, the big ones seem to be coming out quite well. And then you've got consumer staples. So when you look at the quality factor, what is it saying about those sectors completely separate and apart from tech?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFW: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so as Nick was mentioning, we're leaning into that strategy that, you know, screens for those fundamentals that you think of, those high return on equity, that low leverage. And actually, this is a sector neutral strategy. So as Nick mentioned, it does have that inherent overweight to some of those mega cap tech companies. But instead of taking, you know, specific sectoral bets, our team is instead remaining really constructive on kind of these broad, more sector neutral exposures. So when we think about quality from a factor perspective, that's how we're leaning into it. We're not so much going out, really loud overweight any specific sector. So instead we're taking this broad kind of more benchmark approach.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNM: \u003c/strong\u003eBut when you go and also say, Ann, one of the things that you mentioned was that where are the other pockets of opportunity away from what we would call the boring stuff? And Faye can go and talk more to this because this is her model at heart, which is growth at a reasonable price. So one of the things that we need to talk about is there are growth pockets of the monk. Exactly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eG-A-R-P\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFW: \u003c/strong\u003eOne of the uglier acronyms, for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNM: \u003c/strong\u003eThere is growth out there, but what really matters is what valuation are you getting in that?We don't want to be going and buying expensive growth. The companies that – because the relative value that you'll go and get from that is just not going to be as high. So we do go and see growth at a reasonable price in different pockets of the market out there. I would say mostly that's concentrated in places like healthcare and energy right now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eInteresting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNM:\u003c/strong\u003e We think there's some really strong fundamentals there that continue to go and push those sectors forward. But at the same time, you get a really reasonable price, and that's because they've suffered here today. That's because the overweight that many investors had to them last year has moved back. A lot of investors have sold out of those positions, and it means that it's an under-owned part of the market. And in that case, we think that they can go and continue forward in order to go and offer some attractive returns for investors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eInteresting. Let's take a little bit of a different take on this idea of a gap and let's call it mega forces that might be driving longer term growth. That's the term that you use in your report. And these are the kinds of factors that have the potential to impact the inflationary environment to the positive, meaning upward price pressure coming down at longer term. What are some tangible examples of these? Are we going to have to talk about AI? It's impossible to have this conversation at this moment without talking about AI. So let's start there. But I do want to make sure we talk about some other factors as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFW: \u003c/strong\u003eI can hop in here. So as you mentioned in our newest publication, we discussed the notion of, you know, the new macro outlook and asset returns being shaped by these structural forces which we've dubbed mega forces. So these are the powerful transformative forces that drive innovation and then therefore kind of, you know, also drive efficiency. So investors have been really laser-focused on these monthly inflation figures over the past couple of years, but we think you know, beyond just this economic cycle. So as you said, you know, we can't get away from this without talking about AI. It's been, you know, seemingly turbocharged since the rollout of ChatGPT at the end of last year. So we're talking about AI, you know, having the power to revolutionize industries outside of just technology, which is how, you know, we've commonly discussed this theme and instead thinking about it in all sorts of different ways from creating new art forms to improving healthcare outcomes. And in turn, that's impacting different companies in all of those industries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd others, let's find others other than AI. What are some of the other mega forces that you guys have identified?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNM: \u003c/strong\u003eYes, one of the big ones that we often go and talk about is actually demographics and how those are shaping economies. what it comes down to and just, you know, we have to go back to the basics, which is our classic macroeconomic model of the world and what drives economic growth. It's mostly labor, labor growth, and then labor productivity. So obviously AI goes and influences labor productivity side of the equation. Me and my daily job can go and get things done a bit more efficiently because I'm not responding to, you know, dumb emails or, writing things here or there that normally would take me a while. I can be more efficient in my job overall. But then there's the labor growth side of things. So when we talk about demographics, that's what we mean is where is labor growth actually taking place? In developed markets, labor is actually coming down, and that's because birth rates are relatively low. But when you look towards emerging markets, you continue to go and have this labor growth that's taking place. And as a result, it means their economies are going to continue to go and grow overall. So we look towards places like India as a clear example of a country in which they continue to have a strong or growing population, especially in that 30 to 35 age cohort, because that drives a large part of the economy at the end of the day. So demographics is another big one, but there's also many examples of various mega forces. One of my favorites is actually, when it comes to healthcare, we know that there's gonna be aging populations. People are living longer than ever. That means the healthcare sector overall is gonna have to continue to grow in order to go and ensure that there's positive outcomes for an aging population. So these are things are shaping economies as a whole. They take place over five, 10, 20-year spans. They're not necessarily something that can be, that plays out in the coming months. These are large, broader trends and they should go and influence how as an investor, especially if you're investing for a long term, how you start to go and think about allocating capital at this time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eSounds like we're gonna have to hurry up and wait on some of these mega trends then, Nick and Faye. Thank you both so much for joining. Again, that is Nick Morales and Faye Witherold from iShares, a division of BlackRock's investment strategy group. Thank you for joining us today.

We're going to be covering lots of things from The possible TikTok ban and its potential impact. With us today, once again is Mark Mahaney, senior managing director and head of the internet research team over at Evercore ISI. He is also the author of a new book titled Nothing But Net 10 timeless stop picking lessons from one of Wall Street's top tech analysts and we are doing a book giveaway. So if you want to get your hands on a copy, just send a DM to the public live handle. You see it right there on the top of your screen, folks. All right, it's time to get into it. Hi, Mark. Welcome back to public life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Hey, Kori. Good. Hey, good to hear you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, it's good to hear you too. A lot of change actually Mark since I last talked to you. I don't know if you're aware a lot in the financial industry has changed. But today we're gonna focus on the tech stuff and what's happening with TikTok, I mean, the company's CEO, he provided that testimony. He was on Capitol Hill this morning, where he really received some tough, tough criticism with one lawmaker even stating, and I quote, I expect today, you'll say anything to avoid this outcome, but we are not buying it. What were your takeaways from the TikTok CEOs testimony?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e I hope that none of my children ever have to go on the Capitol Hill and testify with the weekend that he had, I wouldn't wish that fate on my greatest enemy. So I'm sorry to carry on being kind of glib about it. But that was, you know, I respect him. And I respect him for going up there and taking that, it's kind of like Zuckerberg, you know, in the last year or two or two years ago, being brought up to Capitol Hill to testify. It's kind of like the leaders of tech being brought up there Bezos and, and Tim Cook, etc, are being brought up to testify that was just unfortunately for TikTok, they're going up against two major issues, social health concerns, related to social media usage. And then much more importantly, these days is national security issues. And so, you know, you knew that the question was just how much defense he could play in that time, and I didn't watchall of the testimony. But that's what I was just struck by and I think maybe more importantly, just today's testimony, the action question for all of us as public market investors because we can't invest in TikTok or, or at least not as a separate standalone asset. I don't think we'll ever see it that way, is what are the implications of this for other social media assets, specifically, Snap, Meta, and Google? And I think the probability of TikTok getting banned in the US is just increasing, you know, relatively materially over the last 12 months. I know there are a lot of constitutional issues around this. And I think they're very serious. But I just think that the odds of some sort of ban or major restriction have increased materially. And so that's kind of a pending catalyst. And anytime the news flow comes up, you'll see names like Snap and Meta outperform on that day, which is what you're seeing today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e You know, I feel what I'm hacking a little bit more in terms of the broader social media context, because you did reference, you know, Zuckerberg having to go up there kind of, you know, defend all the stuff that Facebook, you know, had going on all the negative things specifically, right, that was happening. I mean, you even saw back in the day with Dorsey, he had to go there. Back when he was still leading his company. He co-founded Twitter. I mean, you see it across the board, it doesn't seem to be net like it doesn't seem to be ending anytime soon. And one of my takeaways from what happened today with TikTok, specifically, Mark is that I feel like they're also getting the brunt of all of the aforementioned right, big social media companies. It's like they've had enough time at the batting cage, right? With the Facebooks, with the Googles of the world, with the Snaps that now they're just ready to unleash completely on TikTok.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Kori, I think that's right. But no, but don't forget this. I mean, we got a major political issue, growing political tensions between the US and China. And that's what made this tougher, I think, than anything that the tech companies had to face before because, you know, they,Those are US companies, you know, presenting in front of their elected representatives. That's not the case with TikTok and at the moment when relations between the US and China are at the lowest that they've been and, you know, I'm no expert on that. But um, in some time and maybe decades, so it's just, there's just a lot of different angles here that made it much tougher for TikTok to come through and again, it's kind of hard to see a political out here because it looks to look from where I stand it, it looks like the US military has banned Tiktok from personnel devices, personal and personnel devices. You've had more states do that. You've had a federal government do that you'd like that. That's from government-owned devices. So you've already gotten pretty far down the path here. You've never had that happen with any of the other apps. So and that's not because there's a greater social health issue related to TikTok than there was to Snap or to Facebook. It's because of the Chinese national security issue. So that this is just a bigger, this is just my this is more explosive of an issue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e No, it definitely is something else that you brought up earlier is that you know, you don't think there will ever really see TikTok, as a standalone kind of investable company where people like you or myself, your company would be able to then you know, buy shares in TikTok, it is owned by ByteDance. However, are there some scenarios perhaps in your mind Mark that could play out if TikTok were forced to sell or spin on where it could become, you know, a company at some point that you are I could invest in?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well I don't think so. There was an article in the papers this morning in China that the Chinese government for the first time made an official statement that they would be strongly opposed to a forced sale of TikTok. So I mean, I'm no expert on China, I just assumed that there would be some statement that would come out along the way to this effect. Well, it's out. So I think that's why a ban is such a distinct probability, because I don't think ByteDance will be allowed, even if they wanted to, and I don't think they want to, they wouldn't be allowed to sell TikTok to a US company. So TikTok's in the middle of a geopolitical Firestorm that's, it's unfortunate for them. And you know, I give them all credit. This is a highly innovative company now, whether they actually create a national security risk, that's, you know, there are thorough, thoughtful arguments on that. But anyway, that probably matters. Neither here nor less, it doesn't matter now, Kori, we're not gonna be able to get the chance to invest. So let's focus on the companies that could be derivatives of there. That's Meta. Alphabet because of YouTube and Snap. And I really do think sometimes we spend a little too much time on Snap as a derivative. I think that the use case you know, for those who have used TikTok a lot, you think about what other assets like Snap is more of a communications tool than that kind of leaned forward entertainment tool. That TikTok is but the analogies are really, Instagram and YouTube and those would be the beneficiaries where they were TikTok to be banned.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Okay, that was a foreign mission company is like Google because of YouTube likes Facebook, obviously, also owns Instagram. This is a perfect lead into my next question, because I know over at Evercore, you guys recently hosted a panel with three experts who collectively oversee $1 billion in ad budgets, these are companies that have really been struggling right in the ad space. But the panel revealed some signs that this ad a winter it could be starting to thaw, could you provide some insight into what you're seeing in the ad space, and how we could you know, positively impact some of those other companies that we could invest in?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I think we're still in an ad winter, I think that's what we've uncovered so far with, with the channel checks that we've done, maybe that's not terribly surprising. And, you know, there's a broadening consensus that, that we do have a recession coming. So you know, we could be staying in an ad winter for quite some time. I don't think we're going to see crocus's anytime soon. I think Kori, those are the first plants that show up in the snow out of the snow, but you're also into horticulture Mark, you're a man of many talents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e And somebody can correct me on my pronunciation of crocus's. But, but, but I, I don't, I don't think we're gonna get a quick V shape recovery in marketing spend in advertising spend. And so that's going to be a bit of a drag on some of these names. The advantage and one of the reasons we like Meta frankly, one of the reasons it's our number one recommendation is you don't need to believe that to be long Meta, because they've taken so many of the costs out of their business. And then they've got this new reals, monetization, and they're doing much better targeting than they were years ago. And if you've got this new ad format called click to messaging, click the message which is used much less than the US but it's widely used outside of the US especially in areas of the world like Latin America and parts of Asia. And that's, that's a it's a brand new there's like a product cycle here. You need a product cycle because the overall market is getting soft, and it's not good. It's not firming up yet it's not getting better. And we're still in an ad winter and you know, we should probably assume we're gonna continue to be one for as it's gonna be a long winter it's gonna be several more months at least.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Mark I don't know. I remember you being this type of pessimistic in terms of the ad winter continuing and then you brought up the dreaded R word recession, goodness, a lot of things in what you just said that are very important takeaways. I'm gonna keep it moving, though, because Amazon, this is a company that has been doing a complete like 180 in terms of its firing, it's not doing the speed hiring anymore. They just announced on Monday, they're gonna lay off another 9000 employees. Do you have any thoughts on this mark?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I think the big backdrop here is actually I thought Amazon was the first of the major tech companies to acknowledge that they had over hired overbuilt during the COVID crisis, they said this on their march 22 earnings call that was the that would have been last April, so about a year ago, but then they didn't really act on it. Whereas I think Facebook didn't acknowledge it early, but then they acted on it by laying off a good number of employees. Look, these layoffs are they're no fun for anybody there painful for all people involved. I've gone through it. And, so I wish it on nobody but you know, just as consumer households have to tighten their belts when times get tough. So do corporations, and especially those that over-hired and over-extrapolated from COVID demand trends. And Amazon was one of those, you could actually look they grew their expenses faster than they grew their revenue, and their revenue grew quickly, from 2019 to 2022. So they did overbuilt, they acknowledged it, and they needed to do one or two rounds of cuts, and they've done the two rounds of cuts. As long as we don't go into a steep recession, I don't think they need to do another round of cuts. But doing those cuts was necessary. You also had a bit of a change in but you've had a major change in management over the last two years. It's given a new CEO who's been with the company for 20 years. So he's not new to Amazon by any means. But it gets given them some time to maybe look through all the portfolio of bets, and assets that Amazon hasn't maybe pair some things back maybe not lose $10 billion a year on Alexa, which was a reported number, which was terrifically high. So anyway, I think I think that's kind of what you're getting out of Amazon, which is they're getting deep now into belt-tightening. And I do think that at the end of the day, when we come out of this, and when we get back to more normal economic times, companies are going to be doing this on the lower cost base. And that means you create what I call these EPS slingshot opportunities. So when the revenue recovers on a lower cost base, that means that earnings can grow much faster. And that can be a great long equity opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Let's definitely hope that it will be really quick, Mark, before I get you out of here. I know that you are recently out in Las Vegas for the PROSPER show, which is a gathering of E-commerce sellers and solution providers just really quickly for all the rest of us who were not able to attend the show. What insights did you take away about the Amazon marketplace from that show?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, it's still remarkably a positive experience for most sellers that are on there. And I think you're seeing a lot of them. I guess one of them the most part, the single most interesting takeaway for me was, I think it was 8 out of the 10. Amazon Marketplace, sellers that we spoke to are currently using advertising on Amazon. And Amazon don't tell anybody this but they're generating close to $40 billion a year in advertising revenue, they're going to be the next $100 billion a year ad revenue company. And that's not going to be next year or the year after. But sometime in the next three to five years. They'll be up there. I mean, they're gonna be in spitting distance of Facebook and Google. And because it's a high-intent platform and marketers and advertisers love to be in high-intent platforms. So that was probably the biggest takeaway. Merchants really like advertising on Amazon, watch this space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Wow. Well, the faculty said they're going to be in spitting distance of those big behemoths like Google and Facebook. That's definitely something to watch. As always, we love when you come on Public lot to share your insights. Once again, everyone this is Mark Mahaney, the senior managing director and head of internet research team over at Evercore ISI.

","transcript":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Hello, everyone, and good afternoon and welcome to Public Live this Thursday, March 9th. I am your host, Kori Hale and today folks, we're going to be discussing Spotify’s recent Stream On event and be updating you on Metas year of efficiency as well as other big tech news. And I'm excited because this is one of my favorite guests we have on the show with us today. It's Mark Mahaney, senior managing director and head of the internet research team over at Evercore ISI. Mark is also if that wasn't enough, and it is but he is also the author of a new book titled Nothing But Net 10 times stock picking lessons for one of Wall Street's top tech analysts. And of course, right here on Public, we're doing book giveaway. So if you want to get your hands on a copy, just send a DM to the public alive handle. Alright, Mark, welcome back to public life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e It's good to be back, Kori.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e We're always happy to have you join us. And of course, you break down as some of these big tech names on Wall Street, as I mentioned, and we got to talk about Spotify. The streaming platform recently hosted its Stream On event and announced many new features planned for the app. For those of us who maybe did not catch that announcement, could you provide some insight into some of the standout features that were discussed?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMark Mahaney: Okay, I think this was their fifth annual Stream On event. It's kind of their product. It's like their customer event, but it's really kind of a product development event. I guess that's what it is. It's it's like, it's like Apple's worldwide developer conference. Now not nearly as impactful or meaningful as that, but it's just this is where they roll out their latest innovations. So there was some new disclosure to the founder, Daniel Eck, the CEO announced that they are now over half a billion monthly visitors, which means that monthly average users, which means that they're now a little bit ahead of their guidance for the March quarter, it's a small thing for the financial folks out there. Second is they disclose that Spotify recommendations are powering more than half of users streams. And why that matters is you know, the more that Spotify is music, people who listen to Spotify, listen to curated music, rather than just going on there and saying, you know, I want this song by Taylor Swift, the extent to which they kind of give the wheel, give the mic, give the turntable that's the right one, Kori, give the turntable to Spotify and say, play me something interesting. That means that Spotify becomes more influential, and that means that artists then want to pay to kind of influence To that influence, or that they're willing to advertise, you know that that creates more of an opportunity for them, you know, the, the retailer who simply just fulfills, doesn't generate margins as nice as the retailer who actually suggests and can and can influence tastes and patterns and things like that. And then the last thing that I thought was interesting is they have a new home feed that's coming out. And I think it's a little bit what I would call the TikTok isation of Spotify. So you're gonna see more TikTok-like features short-form video kind of right up front, you can see sort of a little bit of endless feed is the wrong word, but you're gonna see some of that you're gonna see more than just the static feed when you start. So these are all going to all these little nuances that sort of improve, they also talked about an AI DJ, I'm not sure we're going to really notice a difference, but we'll try it out. And then a new ad format, that's kind of a small video ad format, anything that generates ad revenue for Spotify is going to be good for their gross margins. So those are the features that came out of Spotify’s Stream On on event yesterday,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Mark, I love that you brought up actually a plethora things that I want to really quickly piggyback off of. And also, we probably have lots of Swifties in our audience, and they probably were like, Mark, we only play Taylor Swift straight through. We don't need any sort of DJ for that. But the interesting thing about what I are what came to my mind was Payola back in the day, which I might be dating myself back in the radio days, when radio was a massive thing, right in artists, more so record labels are paying radio DJs right to play their particular artists. Are you saying then since there's more of this suggesting type of thing that's going to happen with Spotify going forward that there could be some streaming Payola-ish version at some point?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, you're using a very loaded word and Payola and you know, in some senses, that's what it is. But in some senses, maybe we need to rethink it a little bit. So when you use Google search engine, do you think about all those paid ads within Google as Payola? In other words, you know, when when you do a search for, you know, tickets to March Madness games, basketball games, or when you do a search for, you know, Hawaiian, you know, budget, airfare, and you get these paid results in there. I mean, that's essentially I've thought about this as Google's I'm sorry, as Spotify, Googling it search results, you go on there, and you look at today's top country hits, or today's you know, whatever hit it, and hip hop, I think they've got it, they've got something, you know, for a Christian country, I mean, they've got every possible genre you can imagine in there. And if you're an emerging artist, and if you're in a label, you know, this is like, this is a target-rich environment. I mean, these are people listening to your genre, you're a new artist, you know, like to you to here's an opportunity for you to advertise your song so that Italy shows up somewhere in the queue. Now, many people may not listen to your music, but at least here's a chance to market or advertise. And so that's kind of how we think about it. And so I don't know if that answers your question. But that's what that's the exact intent behind Spotify. And what they've done is given labels the ability to market to advertise their newest labels, their newest features, their newest artists, one of the world's largest, most influential music platforms, if you can make it on Spotify, you can make it anywhere. Spotify makes or breaks artists. And then sorry, but that is true, given how they've got half a billion people who listen to the surface, and probably 250 million who listen to it on a daily basis. There's no music listening service outside of YouTube, that's any bigger any more influential than that. And so that's how I think about and I've always thought about it as a great opportunity last year, I think they generate about $200 million in revenue a little bit more than that, from this what is what I call this advertising revenue. I think it's good for Spotify’s business model. And I also do think it creates opportunities for us of the artists that are on Spotify, here's a chance for them to here's a chance for them to promote their work their blood, sweat and toil.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, you know what, Mark that makes me think what else do you think is good for Spotify his business model because right now you're holding a price target of $185 on their stock with an outperform rating. What is it beyond that? The fact that they're getting this half a billion monthly active users that really, you know, has you all over at Evercore ISI so pro Spotify?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, I am pro Spotify. I was pro-Spotify last year Kori I think you remember that. And the stock tanked. I thought we were going to have an inflection point last year we didn't. And I thought I meant that in terms of gross margins. This is why I like Spotify here and I may be wrong again. You know, but I'm trying to get it right this time. So one, we know that the multiple has come down dramatically on this one This thing goat used to go at four or five, six times, he'd be, you know, enterprise value to sales. Now we're sub two times like that's cheaper than Netflix is cheaper than, well, sort of online dating companies which are somewhat similar. I mean, this is a subscription business and an advertising business, although it's mostly a subscription business. So I think it's cheap. I think the estimates have been de-risk. I think the multiple has then been de-risked. They've started taking some cost actions, they probably overbuilt like a lot of tech companies. So they've been taking some cost actions. But why I particularly like the setup this year, is that I think you're finally at a place where you're going to cut back on some of that podcast investment, heavy spending that they've had. So I think you're finally going to get gross margins to move up. For low gross margin businesses. When you see gross margins move up, it's almost always a major catalyst for the stock. Second is they are likely to implement a price increase their biggest competitors, Apple and Amazon have both implemented a price increase. So it gives it kind of raises the umbrella a little bit and allows them to raise prices. Usually, that's a good thing for companies and for and for stocks. And then the third thing is Kori, last year, they had a record number of new users globally they added the number was something like 70 million. And what typically happens with Spotify is people come on as free users. And then over time, they kind of migrate a decent number of migrate over to be paid subscribers. So if the pick of the record MAU growth last year converts into paid subscriber growth, boom, I got my third catalyst for this year. So that's why I like it. I think the thing can recover to sort of like two times EV to sales. I just don't think that's an aggressive multiple. I know we're in a tough market for for growth equities. This year. This is a company that's been consistently free cash flow positive, admittedly a very small, minimal level, but I do like it and I think it's it's the leading way to play music streaming worldwide. So that's why we that's why we're pitching Spotify is one of our top longs this year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e See Mark just because you were wrong last year, that doesn't mean you're wrong. This year. We're not even before three months into the year and Spotify obviously doing pretty well. However, competition this year for Spotify, right also completely ticking up. This is no pun intended specifically with TikTok, right. This is a major competitive threat. Spotify has, you know, acknowledged this, you know, as part of their business model the company is working to obviously expand its streaming globally. TikTok has already said that, do you actually see Tik Tok as a threat to Spotify? Especially with maybe the legal issues by legal I mean regulatory issues around TikTok in the US.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Kori I may be wrong, but I don't think so. I think the bigger competitive risk really is Apple Music. YouTube music, Amazon music. Those are kind of the more direct So, let's see. Yeah, I think I'm not sure the competition is greater. But yes, TikTok has got a, you know, huge audience worldwide. It's one of those things where can the brand really be stretched? Are people going to really think about like, TikTok is a wonderful experience for you know, for consumers. It's just highly entertaining, addictive, maybe, but also truly highly entertaining. But it's a different type of entertainment than music. And I'm in one of the problems that TikTok is apparently having is getting the rights that Spotify spent a lot of time getting from the labels. So I just, I'm not at all sure that TikTok is going to come out and directly compete with, with Spotify. I'll take the other side on that I may be wrong. I worry about the other companies. But I've just noticed in the seven years I've been running surveys on Spotify, every year, they seem to gain more share of ear can I say that, share of ear you know, like their their share of people listening to streaming music on Android devices. And by the way on Apple devices has pretty consistently risen over the last couple of years. So they're doing something right the real issue on the stock and why it hasn't done anything since its IPO is or direct listing is the business model and people want to see the gross margins go up people want to see them start generating substantial amounts of free cash flow they generate minimal amount but let's get chunky. Let's get a lot of free cash flow. I think they can start gapping up that gross margin this year start growing it I think 10 People can start believing again that there can be sizable free cash flow and that could cause the rewriting in the stock to go up this year. That's why I like it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e All right. No, I I'm with you on that Mark. I want to shift really quickly while we have some time though and cover another big tech company which is Facebook's parent company Meta they're entering into their year of efficiency are since entering I guess it's continuing as the social media giant is expected to layoff thousands more or employees as early as this week. Might I also add it is not lost on me that a company that's shifting into a year of efficiency, which is away from the metaverse after they changed the parent company name to Meta is a lot of questions in my mind around that. However, this is the second largest scale cut these layoffs by Meta. How many more can investors expect as part of this year of efficiency?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I do think it's necessary the year of efficiency. You know, we there's two factors that are going on here. One is that overall demand trends are softening for macro economic reasons. And so layoffs aren't fun. I've gone through them, you know that they're painful for everybody involved, especially if you're one of those people getting laid off. But you know, when times get tough, we all the households tighten their belts and companies need to tighten their belts. And one way you do that, is you unfortunately have to let go some of your employees. The other thing, though, that's one factor. But the other one that Jim maybe just as material and maybe more so is that there clearly are some companies that overbuilt post the COVID crisis, I think Amazon was one I think, Meta was one if you were to go back and look at the revenue growth between 2019 and 2022. And then the OPEX growth, your operating expense growth, you'll see there's a couple of companies that really stick out that they grew their expenses more than their revenue, even though revenue shot up materially between 2019 and 2022, the expenses grew even more. And I think these companies sort of assumed that there was this positive inflection and demand for the services that we kind of continue on for many, many years. That didn't happen. It's not like we've gained, it's not like we've reverted to 2019. It's just that the growth rates have kind of more normalized, rather than just kind of kept it accelerating level. Anyway, all of that is Meta was one of those companies, demand trends are softening for online advertising, no question about it as they are for all marketing spend, and this company over hired, and it's probably the right thing for them to do to take these layoffs. I you know, I think what's been reported recently, I think that is probably going to happen. There's enough there's enough smoke there. There's got to be some hiring fire. I think that's good. I think that actually was a surprisingly good pun. And then I'm going to use that in the note thank you, Kori. And then, but yeah, so I think that's happened. And I think it helps, what investors want to see is defend the bottom line, you know, you can't control what's going to happen to you know, ad marketers, and how much they're going to spend in a recession, you can control your cost basis, and show me that you're going to do that show me your grown-up company. And Zuckerberg kind of weaved and waved a little bit last year. But I think he got to the I think he finally I think most of the signals he gave were it Yes, I'm a mature company, CEO. I'm a CEO, I'm a mature CEO of a company, it may be a mature company. And we need to be much more careful about expenses. And it's not growth at all costs. And when he started to do that, I think he's been rewarded by the market. And I think there's more of that coming. And I also think that the revenue growth trends are going to improve at Facebook because I think they're improving their ad tracking their ad attribution models. And I think they're going to be able to better monetize reels, which I think has turned out to be phenomenally successful for both Instagram and Facebook in terms of new users and more engagement. So I really like Meta here. I think it's still cheap at 14 times earnings. And I think there's 50% upside in the stock. So it's actually my number one pick right now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Wow, number one pick. I didn't know that's where you were going with that mark. But that's that's a strong conviction there. Okay. Number one pick, you know what I was thinking to in the broader tech scheme, something I'd love to get your insights on. We don't have time to do it today. So we'll have to have another session. But I really want to pick your brain around chat GPT around Microsoft's login strategy, how you see that playing into revenue. What does that do to Google? Especially because you brought up ads of the like and how that all could really up in certain business revenue lines across different tech companies. I don't know if you've given that any thought but I'd love to hear what you have to say on that next time around. Next time around. All right, everyone. This was a great session. By the way I love this and I we always love when Mark comes on and shares his insights. Once again, everyone this is Mark Mahaney, senior managing director and head of the interset internet research team over at Evercore ISI don't forget about the book giveaway that we're doing DM us and Public Live handle today.

Joining us today is Paul Graves, CEO of Livent. Livent is a lithium manufacturer powering a range of technologies that impact our everyday lives, including the revolution in electric vehicle batteries and mobile devices. With that, Paul, thanks very much for joining us.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThanks, Ann. Good morning.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLet's start off with a brief overview of what Livent does. If you just break down the technology and applications of your products, that'd be super helpful.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, sure. You know, I'm sure we're gonna get into a little bit of conversation about what exactly lithium is, but Livent is the former FMC lithium, its predecessor company, started in the 1940s. So we've been around a long time, we basically make all the major forms of lithium, so the major funds lithium carbonate, lithium hydroxide, lithium chloride, lithium metal, and have done for many, many years. Our primary product, though, is lithium hydroxide, which is a form of lithium that is used in the manufacture of that higher nickel content batteries that you see in Teslas and other premium vehicles. So the bulk of our business today, at least, is lithium hydroxide.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI feel like I'm back at school in learning the periodic table with all the different formulations. So lots to keep up with. Tell us then a little bit about the partnerships that you have - Tesla, you mentioned BMW and General Motors, to what capacity are you guys working with the automotive and battery manufacturers?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eEach of these manufacturers and basically, most manufacturers, frankly, outside China today, are prioritizing batteries that are using a technology that is a high nickel battery. The reason they do that is simply more energy density and just the profile of that battery is more appropriate for what they're trying to do in terms of extended range, etc. To make those batteries as I said, they need lithium hydroxide. And the reason that they partner with us and we partner with them from their perspective, they're just very few places in the world where you can acquire lithium hydroxide of a quality and of a grade that is usable in a battery application, the process of qualifying can take a year. In fact, we know that one of our competitors spent almost six years getting qualified into a specific battery application.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo this is not a substitutable product and so you have to form partnerships. The same is true, by the way, for us because every single battery manufacturer wants slightly different characteristics in their lithium hydroxide. So also, they can't just run out and buy this product over the counter on a market. They can't they can't pick it up anywhere and just use it. There are some pretty large liability issues for battery failures for OEMs, and we've seen that in the past. And so this idea of having a very reliable, high quality supply of lithium hydroxide is really important to these OEMs.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhen we look at the underlying demand then for license products and we focus in on this EV and market how dependent in your mind Paul is us, EV adoption on government policies specifically?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou know, I think most EV adoption around the world is due to some form of government intervention, whether it's industrial policy in China, or whether it’s regulatory policy in Europe, particularly climate policy, or whether it's something in the middle, frankly, in the U.S. So every country is dependent on that. If the question is, how important is the US market to the global EV industry, it's easily the third out of the three major economic groupings in terms of lithium demand without me read your mind, with China clearly being way ahead of everybody else, Europe catching up quickly and the U.S.\u0026nbsp; very much in third place.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLet's talk about China then Paul has to start the year. We've seen headline declines and Evie demand numbers in China lithium prices in China down by nearly a third relative to November highs. What does that mean for your business? And is this a concerning trend?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou know, I'm going to tell you, the data just frankly, isn't reliable. We don't see prices falling in China, we haven't seen that. It's really a function of there's a lot of there's a lot of forces at work. But looking at a reference price in China, whether it's a fast market and SMM or whoever it may be, is trying to capture a marginal trade in a lithium product that is very rarely representative of the broader market. And I think you may have seen our earnings, you know, we're guiding the way that our average realized prices, is going to be significantly up year over year and we've certainly seen that in January.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd the same is true of EV sales. We always see a dip in January in China because of the lunar holidays. We just saw February data a day or two ago and EV sales in February were up 40% year over year. So we just don't see this dip in sales that everybody else is speaking to. And we certainly don't see any evidence of a reduction in demand for lithium products as a result.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e And just to put this in context, we live in what is the business's exposure to the Chinese market at a macro level?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou know, almost every battery maker today is producing a significant proportion of its cathodes – cathode materials in China, I think it's something like 80-85%, so for a lithium producer, it's extremely difficult to have no China exposure. Our business tends to be though, with Western applications for those cathodes. So we may supply them lithium hydroxide from our U.S.. plant which largely will go to Korea or Japan, or will supply from our China plant which will largely be processed in China, but the resulting cathode or battery or cell is leaving China and ending up in a western OEM.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLet's talk a little bit about some headline news that hit last week poor the world's largest electric vehicle battery maker contemporary Amperex Technology announced it was changing its pricing strategy and signing contracts with EV makers at “discounted prices.” \u003c/span\u003eWe saw lithium stocks including Livent you know, take a bit of a hit following that news. Could you just talk a little bit about your reaction to what is this something that's shaking up the market? Or is this a temporary hit to supply demand dynamics?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e I think the move in the share price, it shows you how emotional investors are about lithium, unfortunately. There's not a lot of analytics behind the way we trade on a daily basis. It’s clear what CATLR have offered is first and foremost, this offer is only as far as we can tell to Chinese OEMs. So it's not an offer to anybody else. Secondly, that OEM must commit to buy over 70% of their batteries from CATL. In order to achieve that, and then they will price the battery as though lithium is at I think for lithium carbonate $30 equivalent. CATL is frankly largely a carbonate based battery producer, not hydroxide, we don't have a massive amount of exposure to CATL. We do have some - not to any Chinese manufacturers that we're aware of.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI'd also point out that in 2022 Livent’s average realized price for lithium wasn't $30 it was lower than that. And so it's not like $30 is suddenly this catastrophic price. If you go back a couple of years, the industry really wasn't expecting to see pricing north of $20 for any sustainable period. So for CATL to say that now in the long run, they're gonna guarantee $30 I mean, to me, it just fundamentally is an acknowledgment and an admission that the historically low prices of lithium are not coming back.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo there's been an upward rebasing that's interesting. You know electric vehicles\u0026nbsp; have really captured the imagination of the market, and particularly here on Public. We see a lot of interest in that use case, but live it when you actually go and read about the company, your products are using so many more end markets, aerospace, pharmaceuticals, take us a little bit through some of those other end markets.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIt's interesting if you go back, not even six or seven years, we IPO’d in 2018. And the bulk of our business was not into automotive applications. And I think it was not until 2021 that it actually tipped over the edge. Even today in energy storage applications, EVs globally are between 55 and 60% of total installed capacity on a gigawatt hour basis. So EVs while they're \u0026nbsp; the biggest part of the energy storage industry, there's 40% or so that is non EV and application. For us, we have a little unusual business and I told you the beginning we have all the products and the lithium chloride and lithium metal chain, which by the way is the key to future solid state batteries will be the lithium metal side.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eToday, lithium metal is largely used in a product we make up utility. Put any chemist on the phone. And you'll get excited about utility for some bizarre reason. But it's a product that's used to manufacture lots of other stuff, everything from drugs, polymers, a whole bunch of synthesis applications, it's got very, very broad applications that makes about a third of our revenue today.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhen I look at your business pool, and folks can find this in your earnings results, in 2022 numbers, it looks like revenue came in at $813 million adjusted EBITDA at $367 million. So there's heft and scale to your business that's been engaging in a number of capacity expansion projects. Can you talk a little bit for us about what it is like to be undertaking expensive capital intensive construction projects in a rising rate environment?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, it's an interesting challenge for certainly being more profitable helps us fund this. We also have no net debt, we have about 200 million of cash on our balance sheet today. Largely, frankly, because customers are stepping up for companies like Livent that are credible, that can actually have demonstrated that we can actually producing usable lithium chains, they're willing to commit capital to help us expand. Expanding is hard, lithium is incredibly difficult to produce, because it really, really has two steps to it. And the vast majority of expansions or even companies out there with lithium in the name actually will never produce any usable lithium, they'll produce an intermediate.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhat we're trying to build is a fully integrated resource all the way through the chemical plant operations. We do that today, through our resource in Argentina. Our resource in Argentina was about 4,200 meters or 13,000 feet above sea level. So it's incredibly remote and there’s villages 110 kilometers away. And we are trying to put over a billion dollars of capital into expanding that mine and it just takes a long time. A lead time for items in every industry, but certainly because of the EV boom, the same is true of nickel or copper, there's a lot of overlap in material, it can take us two or three years to actually get pieces of equipment delivered. So it's an arduous and complicated process, to be perfectly honest.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd then just the last question for you, Paul, which touches on this issue of policy, you've talked about your footprint in China, you've just touched on your footprint in Argentina. How much.. and this is really at the industry level not necessarily at the moment level, how much are you seeing impetus, at least from a policy perspective to do more in your production process here in the United States?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e It's a mixed bag and a mixed message. I think it's fair to say at the federal level, there's a desire to bring as much of the value on shore. The value if you think about the chain starts in mining run through chemical processing into manufacturing of cell components to the cells the cell packed and ultimately the vehicle. And I think it's probably far too fair to say that most policy starts at the vehicle and works its way backwards. And in terms of its desire to have the actual production on shore, there's a debate about whether they really want mining in the U.s. and that's certainly the case at the local level.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhen you get into states or local communities we do get huge push backs as an industry or in the mining industry about mining in the U.S. It’s different in Canada but in the U.S., it's not entirely clear to me that there's a big policy commitment to the mining. They do want the chemical process and we have a site at Bessemer city in North Carolina where we produce lithium hydroxide. We just built another 5,000 ton plant there and we've committed to build another 15,000 ton plant there. So there is definitely commitment to that but the material that feeds that plant will ultimately come from Argentina, not from a minor the U.S.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLots going on in the industry, everyone that was Paul Graves, CEO of Livent.

I'm your host Kori Hale and I'm thrilled to be here with you as part of Public and Culture Banks is Black History Month series in which we'll be talking to builders and thought leaders to gain perspectives into issues and opportunities that have particular relevance to the black community, which makes me super excited. So for today's show, we're going to be unpacking the business side of nio changes that name, image and likeness that came to the collegiate sports world in 2021. Our guests today are Brandon Wimbush and Ayden seal, which I hope Aiden, I'm saying your last name correctly. They're the cofounders of mobile, which is an nio compliant marketplace for athletes and brands. Braden Aiden, welcome to public life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAyden Syal:\u003c/strong\u003e It's nice to meet you guys. Thank you for having us. We're really excited.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e We're definitely happy to have you in Ayden. I actually think I'm gonna kick this off with you. For our community members and listeners right now I'd love for you to give us some quick context exactly on what nio means Here's how it's changed in the past few years since coming to collegiate sports in 2021. And really what this means for those college athletes to be able to monetize their own names?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAyden Syal:\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely Kori, it's such a pleasure to be here. So thank you for this opportunity. So for our listeners, what name image and likeness means it's effectively the ability for a student athletes. So that's a collegiate athlete, and now in some high school states as well, the ability to monetize their publicity rights and make money off of their platform and audience. Now, it's important to clarify, this is not referred to pay for play, universities are not compensating any of their athletes for direct performance on the field. However, now student-athletes throughout the country can explore opportunities to monetize their publicity, and their platforms, and audiences by connecting with brands for sponsorship opportunities, engaging with fans for exciting and NIL monetization opportunities, and anything else that they historically have not been able to do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eSo this is clearly a massive deal. And we've seen, you know, a lot of college athletes that perhaps, you know, we kind of heard about, but we really didn't see them making any money unless they were able to make it to the professional level. So Brandon, I'm gonna bring this to you exactly. How long have collegiate athletes been fighting for these new type of policies? And I'm gonna throw in something else here because I think of a company like overtime, sports and what they're doing at the high school level. Is it possible as well, that we can see this trickle down?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrandon Wimbush:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, Kori. college athletes have really been fighting for this ever since the NCAA since the inception of the NCAA, right, which is over a century-long. I think it really took the front stage during Ed O'Bannon, recent case, which went to the court in 2009. So I'm sure some of you guys remember Ed O'Bannon. Being on the national championship basketball team. UCLA's national championship basketball team in 1995. And the fact that the NCAA continued to use his NIL, after his collegiate career and some of his teammates, right, that sparked up a lot of interest around not only the ability for college athletes to make money, but how else the NCAA was exploiting and some of the antitrust laws that the NCAA was, you know, kind of proposed with, if you will, right, so this has been a this has been many decades in the in the works. It came about super quickly. The first, the first governor to enact some NIL laws was California's Governor Gavin Newsom in 2019. When actually when he was on the LeBron James show the shop, he had signed a bill that was going to allow college athletes in the state of California to make money come 2023. But obviously, so much had progressed since that viewing and you know, things kind of took a quick turn. And obviously, we're here right after July of 2021. When when everything went into effect at a national level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eBrandon, do you think that we can see maybe some high school athletes be able to one day monetize their NIL?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrandon Wimbush:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, of course. Sorry about that. I forgot the second part of your question. But like even mentioned, there are some high school there are some states now that are allowing high school athletes. I think we're up to maybe 20 or so states on the high school level, they're allowing their athletes to, to make money. And from our perspective, it's great, right? It's great that, you know, some I mean, you guys are probably familiar, the most recent big stories around the quarterback that was committed to the University of Florida, had an NIL deal. I believe it was signed, or whatnot. And it was for around $13 million. But then that contract had fallen through. And now he's, you know, decommitted he got to appeal. His is his LOI, which is the letter of intent that you sign, which generally doesn't happen. So it just adds it's adding a new component to all levels of sports, high school, college sports, and how we're thinking about it from the high school level Kori is we want to be able to educate you have more than you know, I don't even know the numbers, right, but millions of high school athletes, and 99% of them really won't be able to monetize on a massive level. So how can we help those athletes still with the ability to monetize and build their personal brands, so when those athletes who do get to college, they have a little bit of a head start?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, that's definitely important and actually like that you mentioned LeBron James earlier because it actually is his son, who really sits at the top of the NIL mountain and he is someone who's in high school and not in college, but pulls in, you know, five plus million dollars a year. So we're definitely seeing it at different levels. But I want to bring this back to the broader mogul company and our platform that you all have created. I mean, it is this marketplace for athletes to connect with brands for these NIL deals that we're referencing right now. And Ayden, I'm gonna bring you back in on this, and what are some of the main pain points that you're solving for both sides of this marketplace?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAyden Syal:\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely, Kori. So the number one pain point that we're solving for both for student athletes and for brands looking to engage with these incredibly powerful influencers is just access. So on the student-athlete side, when you think about a student-athletes experience at school, they largely don't have access to these brands, the time in their schedule to source these opportunities, the experience doing so, or the ability to really figure out exactly what their brand identity is. So for us, what we're doing is we're providing a seamless and most importantly compliant solution for these student-athletes to connect with brands, and also fans for monetization opportunities. On the brand side, the value that we're providing to them is that there are 500,000 collegiate athletes throughout the country. And it's now been proven and the data backs it that this subset of influencer is 12 times as valuable as the next subset of influencer across social media. So what we're doing is we're providing brands the ability to directly connect with thousands of these influencers at one time, in order to reach new markets, hard to reach markets, and specifically target Gen Z audiences as they look to build awareness for their products and services. Now, when you take the platform into account, there's obviously a lot of benefit to using a platform like mobile in when engaging with athletes. So number one, is a seamless connection and communication process associated between a brand and an athlete. Number two, you're ensuring that your student-athletes that you're working with are protected, and that their eligibility remains intact because that activity is automatically being disclosed to their university compliance policies. And then number three, we actually save brands a lot of time, money and effort by automatically generating contracts for them to engage with athletes on as well. So we're saving them a ton of time, money and effort when engaging with this incredibly powerful and valuable subset of influencers. And then for student-athletes, we're broadening their horizon and connecting them to exceptional opportunities with leading brands and local businesses as well, in a fully compliant and seamless way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Ayden, what are some of these brands that you guys are working with? Let's hear a few names.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAyden Syal:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, absolutely. So the one of the beautiful things about mogul is that we're not only working with Fortune 500 brands, but we're also working with local businesses throughout the country, because of our commitment. And our thesis when we started this that all college athletes provide value within the name image and likeness landscape. So some of the brands that we've worked with over the past couple years that you'd recognize are Toyota, Activision, DoorDash, Allbirds. And then we're extremely excited as well about a partnership that we've structured with NBC Sports, in which we're helping NBC Sports to manage their NIL activities on behalf of their advertising network. Additionally, you know, in markets like Austin, Texas, Columbus, Ohio, Ann Arbor, Michigan, we've connected local delis, burger joints, gyms, health and wellness companies, to student-athletes, as well, because these student-athletes provide essentially a bridge and an avenue directly into the undergraduate population. Which, if you've ever been to a college town in the US, you understand that college towns like South Bend, Indiana revolve around that population and ultimately, their business as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Yes, they definitely do. Aidan and I've been to many college towns as an alumni of Syracuse University and Hampton University in Virginia. I know exactly what you mean. And I love that you brought up the fact that you know, it's all college athletes right that deserve this type of opportunity with NIL deals, which Brandon brings me back to you because you were a former college athlete at Notre Dame. So what is your perspective as a former college athlete you bring to mobile and why do you think having an athlete boys such as yourself at the table? Why is that so important?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrandon Wimbush:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, Kori Before I move on to that question that central recognizing that it's Black History Month, the deal that we did with Toyota was with two HBCU athletes, and one was Monet Davis, who people probably remember from Little League World Series, and I think it was 2012. And now she's grown up, and she's a successful softball player at Hampton and we got to work with her because Toyota prioritizes, their involvement with HBCU programs across the country. So that was pretty awesome. And one that we're really excited about. As far as just having the athlete perspective, kudos to Ayden, you know, he originally drew up the business plan, way, way, way, way before NIL was even taking into into effect in 2019. And we had known each other we're both from northern parts of New Jersey, so we had connected, went to rival high schools, and we known each other from Notre Dame as well. And so he reached out to me to kind of gain the athlete understanding of, you know, going about building a marketplace and a product that was going to serve college athletics. What does the athlete kind of want? And how can a product like this benefit them? So from that point on, we had that initial conversation, I was like, let's take this one step further. I think the athlete perspective is going to be so pertinent to your experience building a company, and you should have somebody you know, someone like myself, who had played at a high level, but then also went through so many trials and tribulations, right. Like, I think me getting benched in my second year of playing is a perfect example of market your marketability, while it's at its peak, right? Obviously, I'm very fortunate played quarterback at Notre Dame. So it's kind of on the, it's kind of, you know, on the side of not being, you know, the common ground for NIL, right. And that's kind of where we're servicing is that middle ground of that 99% 98% of athlete who's not going to have that ability to go play professionally. And so we've been able to really tap in with to that 90% of our team, internally, are former collegiate athletes, and their swimmers, their track runners, the wrestlers that we have, right, but it's, it's that ability to connect with athletes, that I think gives us a leg up in terms of understanding what they go through on a daily basis, how they're going to want to navigate an app, right, just like understanding that use of use component of building out an app for college athletes, like, you know, we want everything to be done in a streamlined manner. We're generally very organized, we don't want to have to go through many steps. And so that ability in that understanding has been in served and valuable for us these past 20 months.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Brandon, I love that you mentioned that the majority of your staff, the majority of your team and mobile are former athletes, it's making me think you guys must have some like one of the biggest groups of former athletes as employees outside of like a sports media type of company. So I think that's really, really cool. But I want to dig in a little bit deeper on the NIL deals given that you are a former athlete, how equitable are some of the deals that you're seeing come across your platform?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrandon Wimbush:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, I think they're pretty equitable. I think what we do a good job of is giving open visibility to brands to see some of the other opportunities that live on the platform. And then they can understand the traction that those types of campaigns have from other brands, and in terms of being able to attract the talent that they want to attract. You know, as far as the athletes go, and I guess to my point earlier of like, kind of being on the other spectrum, the NIL deals that we see in public are really not NIL right, like, I mean, it's, it obviously is NIL but it's the high school kid making $10 million. And Bronnie James making $6 million coming in. That's not what we're servicing. And that's not what the common college athlete is going through. And so people have to understand that that's, that's very far in between. And so we really feel and have done a good job of educating the brands that come to the mobile platform, shout out to our sales team and the people internally that educate the brands on hey, here's how to best suit or create a campaign and an opportunity that's going to be able to attract all of our 8,000 athletes that we have on the platform, right? So brands have done a phenomenal job of that. There's more data to go around now, right within the entire NIL marketplace. female athletes have really really done a phenomenal job. And I would argue lead the way in terms of NIL and, and brand building and just success in this space. And it's been phenomenal to see 60% of the athletes on our platform are female sports. You know 65% of revenue generated on our platform has been from non-revenue generating sports, right? So that's all sports other than your football, and men and women's basketball. So we've seen some really phenomenal, equitable success, we would argue on our platform, at least.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eKnow that sounds amazing. And you know, guys, this has been a very strong 20 minutes here. So Ayden and I actually like to wrap things up with this final question out to you because, you know, we're still very early in this entire NIL process, as I referenced, it's just really came to collegiate to athletes, officially in 2021, besides some of the early stuff that the governor of California was doing back in 2019. So what do you think the future holds when it comes to brand partnerships with college athletes and what's really the long-term opportunity for businesses?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAyden Syal:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, of course, frankly, the sky's the limit as it relates to the future. One of the things that we've observed only in the two years since name image and likeness has been around is that individual student-athletes have drastically expanded the value that they can actually provide to brands because they've honed in on influencer marketing strategies and skills. They've identified what brands their personal brand would provide the most value to and whom they align most closely with. But also, as more and more college athletes get educated both at the institutional and university level, but also in the market in general, this industry, and the opportunity for brands is only going to expand. Now, as it relates to brand partnerships with college athletes. I think this just becomes more and more of the status quo, right? Obviously, right now, we're referring to this whole industry as name image and likeness. But ultimately, this isn't going anywhere. And it's not being repealed anytime soon or ever. So as a result, I think these influencers in general are just going to be more associated as standard traditional influencers, as opposed to all of their deals constantly being marketed or tagged as Oh, this was a name, image, and likeness deal. And as more brands witness and observe their competitors, and other members of their industry leveraging this incredible solution, we think that this is only going to grow. Yeah, we're extremely excited.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e And I'm excited for this super cool platform that you guys are doing and because you have the opportunity to make a very big difference in the life of many collegiate athletes.

","transcript":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eHello everybody and welcome to Public Live. I'm your host Ann Berry and looking back, it has been a bit of a bumpy and unpredictable year in the markets. But some pockets did see momentum, one of them being electric vehicles, which stand to benefit potentially from the Inflation Reduction Act that was passed earlier this year. So that's what we're going to focus on today, electric vehicles or EVs, their latest developments, and what's on the horizon as we head into 2023. Here to discuss all of this is Jay Jacobs, US head of Thematics and Active Equity ETFs at iShares. Jay, welcome back to Public Life.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd thanks so much for having me. It is great to be back on Public Live for one more time in 2022.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eI cannot believe 2022 is nearly over. I feel like the EV sector share, when you look at their share prices, are probably pretty glad that we're going into a new year, a new chapter, and putting this one behind us definitely had a busy couple of years, we have seen looking back at this year an increased interest from consumers, two major ride-hailing companies all promising to adopt electric vehicles into their fleets and the industry has been one that just can't seem to slow down. So I'd love to kick off today's show with you by walking through some of the highlights that you've tracked from the last year in the sector.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, I would say there are a few things. You know, first off, this was really kind of the year where EVs became less of a niche product and more of a mainstream product. We see that in adoption numbers. So if you look at the first half of 2022, EVS made up 26% of car sales in China, about 20% of passenger car sales in Europe, and the US actually lagging behind by only about 6%. But that is still very big numbers in a very large market around the world, showing that EVs are really coming onto the scene in a meaningful way. You add, on top of that, that we've had several car models come out this year. So basically, every major car brand has an EV now, and you see, it's not just sports cars, SUVs, it's vans, it's lower price sedans, really a model for every kind of buyer and price point out there. And then finally, yeah, we have the Inflation Reduction Act, which is one of the largest commitments ever to support the adoption of electric vehicles and clean energy, about $370 billion from the US government over the next 10 years or so, which is going to provide things like subsidies for building EV subsidies for buying EVs to really accelerate the growth of this segment. So it was, yes, 2020 was a difficult year for almost any investor in any segment of the market. EVs not being the exception. But there were a lot of things to still get excited about in the Eevee space and 2022.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eJay, let's break down a little bit more the legislation and hone in on the role of the Inflation Reduction Act. You hit the headlines for $370 billion over how long is that investment going to be made?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so it's roughly over about 10 years. This doesn't all get spent at once. And that's kind of the design, right, is that what the IRA is trying to do is accelerate the adoption of a technology that otherwise is seeing good adoption, but the US government wants to do it faster. And there are really two different ways to do that. One is increased demand. And the easiest way to increase demand is to make something cheaper. So the way that they're doing that is a $7,500 tax credit for new EVs, a $4,000 tax credit for used EVs, spurring demand by making them more affordable. The other way to do that is to increase supply. And that's actually incredibly important in the market that we're in today. Because there are actually not enough EVs to buy right now. If you try to buy a Ford F150 Lightning, you can't do it. If you want to buy, you know, some of the top models, you know, model three long ranges and make Mustangs, there are long waits, if you can even get on a waitlist right now. So the idea is, how do we spur more supply by using things like incentive tax credits and production tax credits to get these companies to build more manufacturing plants in the United States as well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eInteresting that you break down the demand and supply aspects of it so succinctly, Jay. When you think about which of those pieces are going to have the nearest term momentum, tax credits for purchasing EVs, when are they going to kick in, and then subsidies for buying more EV plants? When are they going to start getting kicked in?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eWhen the tax credits get hit as early as next year? The tax credits for building manufacturing plants could also start to come into play next year. But you know, we have to realize building a manufacturing plant is a two to three-year, four-year process even so we're not really going to see the commercial benefits of that for some time.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eLet's let's look a little bit more at trends for 2023, specifically Jay, which industries are looking to add EVs to their fleets? The famous one, of course, was Amazon, which had an agreement with Rivian to try and bring EVs into their delivery fleets. What are the other examples that you can walk us through of different industries moving into electric vehicle adoption?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eI think two are really exciting right now. So one is when we look at semi trucks, so the 18-wheelers you see on the highway, very expensive vehicles that use a lot of gas. We're starting to see progress in the electrification of that fleet. And astute listeners may have noticed the Tesla semi has been tested on the roads recently, with companies like PepsiCo putting in orders for dozens of Tesla semis going forward. So that's a really exciting development in switching the fleet from gas to electric. And then secondly, this just came out yesterday; the US Postal Service, which is the biggest operator of vehicles in the federal government in the United States, is going to put in place about 66,000 electric vehicles over the next decade or so. So this is massive, this is going from, you know, just electric vehicles being kind of a niche sports car, to really being the predominant form of passenger vehicles or light-duty vehicles or even heavy-duty vehicles and the Tesla semi example going forward. So these are exciting times.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eThis is x 1000s. Quite the number doing know, Jay, which manufacturers and which brands are going to be procured from.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, they're there from a couple of brands. One is Oshkosh, which is more of a military supply company, but builds a lot of postal service car tracks, and the others are going to come from the private sector, more from major car brands even announced which ones yet. Here's the fun fact, though, the little postal service truck that people have seen on the roads for decades only gets about eight miles per gallon. So you can see pretty quickly how switching to an electric really ramps up the efficiency of the postal service not just to reduce emissions, but to reduce operating costs; no longer paying so much for gas can actually really lower costs for shipping.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eLet's talk a little bit about EV stocks, Jay, because for people interested in electric vehicles and looking to play in the market, I'm curious if you'd be able to share some of the high-level signals or metrics that you and your team look for when evaluating EV players?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eSure. So really, the primary thing that we look at is revenue from the EV ecosystem. Now the art in that is really what is the EV ecosystem. It's very obvious to say that EV manufacturers, like some of the hubs that we've mentioned already, are very key to the electric manufacturers like some of the hubs that we've mentioned already are very key to the electric vehicle theme. But it actually goes far beyond that. And so you can think about, you know, who are the companies that actually build the batteries that go into electric vehicles, they're obviously part of the ecosystem, who's doing the lithium mining and processing that goes into those batteries, who's building the electronics and the parts that are supplied into electric vehicles. And there are really dozens of companies beyond some of the headline names that are really participating in the ecosystem. We often call this thematic beta or thematic risk, the risk here being these companies are tied to the potential adoption of electric vehicles. If the adoption for electric vehicles happens the way that we expect it to, these companies will be rewarded for that risk. If electric vehicles get supplanted by new technology, or for some reason, don't make it, they don't get escape velocity, and the internal combustion engine lives on, then companies with this thematic risk would be punished. But what we are really looking at is what are the companies that have that highest thematic risk to the electric vehicle ecosystem. And we really measure that by who gets the most revenue from electric vehicles and the entire ecosystem.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd how about in the US versus internationally? I mean, the Inflation Reduction Act here in the US has caused enormous momentum domestically. Are there players you look at or parts of the supply chain that you look at internationally and that are publicly traded?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eOh, absolutely. Yeah. I mean, this is a theme that is not confined to borders. Yes, we saw, you know, the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States. You know, we've seen other efforts in China and Europe to spur greater electric vehicle adoption as well. So it's really a global theme, and we see global companies participating in it. There are a lot of battery manufacturers coming from South Korea and beyond. There are a lot of lithium miners in Australia. There are parts suppliers all around the world as well. So when we think about this theme, we are absolutely looking at it through global hubs.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eCan we talk a little bit about how EV ETFs work Jay, as an investor, thinking about adding EV exposure to their portfolio\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, absolutely. So EV ETFs are really trying to get exposure to that EV ecosystem by investing in companies around the world. So, for example, our IDRV ETF and iShares invest in lithium mining companies, refiners, battery producers, and car manufacturers in the electric vehicle space, as well as part suppliers, and really provides exposure to that entire ecosystem in one ETF. This has many benefits for investors, but one of them being it's hard to identify these companies on your own because they're not just US large-cap brand names. It can be smaller international companies. It's just hard for individual investors to access this ecosystem at the individual stock level. Secondly, there's just a lot of efficiency and doing this through an ETF rather than going out and buying 50 companies around the world on your own. You can put in an order for one ETF like IDRV and get exposure to that entire basket with one trade. So, you know, when we design an ETF like IDRV, we're really focused on capturing the pure-play companies across the entire ecosystem of a theme, in this case, electric vehicles, to get that exposure to investors.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd then, Jay, could you give us a little bit of color on a couple of things that help with the myth-busting? Because EVs have tended to seem like the cars of the future. They're sort of here with us now. But what are some of the assumptions that people may still have about electric vehicles that maybe just aren't true?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eI think one of the biggest misconceptions is that they're still expensive. Yes, there are EVs at very high price points. But there's actually several models that are coming in below the average purchase price of a new vehicle in the United States, which is about $50,000 these days. On top of that, you have tax credits, which can make them even cheaper. And then, on top of that, you have lower maintenance. So electric vehicles don't need an oil change each year. Actually, through regenerative braking, it's less frequent that you need to do brake pads and brake rotor replacement. No spark plugs to replace every 50,000 miles. So it is already cheaper in many instances to own an electric vehicle than an internal combustion engine when you look at the entire lifetime ownership. So you ought you add all that together. And the economic argument for electric vehicles is really starting to come into the forefront here, which we believe is only going to accelerate adoption. It's not just about is this a better car? Do I like the car? Do I like how it looks? If it is cheaper off the land or cheaper over the lifetime ownership experience? We think that's really going to bring the mass markets into the Evie space.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eWhat about Jay, one thing that just come up? Recently, I looked at a company that was trying to find ways to make it easier for Evie owners to be able to charge their vehicles. How about that element? Is the infrastructure going to be there to support getting more electric vehicles on the roads?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eIt's certainly growing. And we've been talking a lot about the Inflation Reduction Act. But another piece of policy in the United States is really accelerating electric charging, which was the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act passed last November. The idea behind that act is to put about seven and a half billion dollars into building 500,000 chargers around the country. So a lot more densification of electric charging. This, in many ways, is basically a subsidy for EV buyers because if there are more chargers and there are faster chargers, in the places that you want to see them. You don't need as big of a battery. And so, if you have a smaller battery, you don't have to pay as much for an electric vehicle. So you can see how different policies from the US government are really trying to accelerate adoption, whether it's tax credits for buyers, whether it's incentives for manufacturers, or building up a charging infrastructure.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eWith that, I want to thank you, Jay Jacobs, Head of Thematics and Active Equity ETFs at iShares.

Thank you so much for joining us. My name is Julia Rothacker. I'm the director of concierge here at Public. And we're thrilled to be with you today to talk a little bit about the reggae IPO of Shrek music royalties. Keith, would you like to introduce yourself?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHey Julia, for those who haven't met me yet? I am Keith Marshall GM of alternatives here at Public.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePerfect then let's dive straight in. Keith. I know this is a serious investment. But I'm also guessing everybody wants to hear about Shrek.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course. You know, as most of you should already know. Shrek is a bad tempered but good hearted ogre, who goes on a variety of quests in his fairy tale world. So Shrek is just a massive media franchise. It's the 17th highest-grossing film franchise of all time. And the second-highest-grossing animated film franchise which generated over $4 billion in box office sales just wild stats. And interestingly, there's actually a rumored fifth film possibly to be called Shrek Five. And you know as it's grown, the Shrek franchise has just really kept pace with streaming becoming evermore important in this media landscape. So the first two films launched on Netflix in March 2022. And were in the top 10 viewed when they were launched. Another wild stat customers watched 20.8 million Shrek and Shrek Two in the week they launched on Netflix. Those two movies have since shifted over to Peacock, which is obviously the affiliated owner of the Shrek franchise, but some are still visible on Netflix.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGreat. And now let's shift a bit to what the investment offering is here. What exactly is a royalty?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYeah, most people actually don't know what royalties are so short answer royalty interests are intellectual property. They're part of the copyright law. So really, the royalties are the actual payments. So the royalties are the payments that come to us from use of this content, the Shrek underlying content, and they're collected by what's known as performing rights organizations basically just like large clearing houses. These PRO's are what actually manage the rights on behalf of rights holders. So royalties are actual payments PRO's their job is to collect these payments from all these underlying sources of content distribution when the music from the Shrek franchise really you know the actual movies are used.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks Keith and can you explain what exactly triggers a royalty payment for FRAC?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo this catalogue generates royalties from a bunch of different sources you know, use of the tracks in the movies when the movies are streamed or sold on theme park rides there's a holiday TV special called Shrek The Halls there are even Broadway plays about Shrek all of these different things lead to royalties being generated. And you know, that's it even makes money when the movie I Am Legend plays because Will Smith's character actually watches Shrek during I Am Legend. So a significant portion of these royalty earnings have come from international sources. So this asset actually benefits from not being tied solely to the US market as well. Relatedly there are a ton of references on Reddit videos on YouTube about people actually learning English from watching Shrek, that may be one of the reasons that international viewing is and has been so strong for Shrek. But you know, of course, broadcast and streaming represent the main portion of earnings just because you know the people watching Shrek so a question that's come up a few times from people that I want to clarify. This is the score, not the soundtrack. So Smash Mouth all-star is not included. But like Fairy Tale which some of you may know from recently going viral on TikTok is included. So this is the score just the underlying orchestral music.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYes, I certainly have seen Fairy Tale a lot recently. So that gives a lot of clarity on how Our Shrek royalties work, and I am a big Shrek fan. So I love it. But this is also a an investment. Why would someone invest in royalties?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, as an attorney, we have to present a disclaimer, investors should always do their own research and understand all of these risks to consider before investing. But, you know, stepping back public's goal as a platform is to give investors tools that's investment products, and actually the education as well to build these modern diversified portfolios. And to answer your question, royalties can produce cash flow, which you know, in the current interest rate environment can definitely be appealing to investors. So in the case of the Shrek offering, any royalties received by the entity that holds these royalty interests will be paid out in the form of quarterly dividends. So royalties also benefit from being less correlated with other assets, you know, like Exchange Traded equities, because, again, they're driven by content consumption, not you know, for example, what the stock market is doing going up and down or doesn't, those things don't directly impact how people are watching Shrek and reduce correlation, cashflow. These can help investors lower portfolio volatility and hopefully increase returns on a risk-adjusted basis. So royalties are an investment tool.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks. And I understand that royalties are actually an established asset class.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYeah, so most people don't realize that this really is an investment product. And, you know, to date, institutional investors have just dominated the space is a direct example, the Michigan State employee pension funds have billions of dollars invested in music royalties, and catalogs can just sell for massive amounts, like the recent $225 million sale of Katy Perry's catalogue. You know, most people just can't participate in something like that. So with the Shrek royalties offering, investors can access royalties with as little as a $10 investment. And, you know, most of us don't have hundreds of millions to spend on a single asset, but Public wants to make these public markets actually work for all people. So this offering makes royalties more accessible to everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat makes sense. And why Shrek music within all music royalties,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eyou know, we talked about the Shrek franchise, and that's actually not the starting point for this thing. First and foremost, it's a mature asset. It has a 20-plus-year earnings history. And while we can't predict performance, you know, that means we're not relying on like how a single song by a single artist has done in the past year to assess what could happen in the next five years. It's also a strong recent historical performance, you know, earnings have actually grown in recent years due in part to streaming. We saw that last year with an earnings bump from Shrek on Netflix. And again, past performance is, of course, no guarantee of future results, but it makes our own analysis more meaningful. So comparing the 2022 calendar year earnings to the offering amount, the asset produced an eight-and-a-half percent return after fees. So it's also a life of rights interest, meaning this royalty interest is valid for the life of the composer Harry Gregson Williams plus seven years and Gregson Williams is 61 As of today. Lastly, it is Shrek we already discussed like it's an awesome media property and you know, Shrek Five could theoretically reinvigorate interest in the rest of the franchise, which could potentially increase royalty earnings. So again, Shrek Five does not yet have a release date. And recent strikes could of course, delay that, but we hope the movie is indeed forthcoming.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOkay, Keith, last question for you. How does the process work if someone wants to invest?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo the offering is $889,700 in total $10 a share, but it can be oversubscribed. So we can actually take in requests for more than the 889k. As of today, the offering is reached about 77% of its total allocation. So it really just you go in the Public app or on our site and you can request shares at the Shrek asset page. After we receive these requests for at least the total offering amount the 889,700 we will process the closing and at that point, investors will be eligible for dividends after the closing. In addition to being eligible for these dividends, investors can participate in a secondary market, meaning they can buy and sell shares from one another on the Public platform. And I want to close out with a reminder that dividend payments aren't guaranteed. They depend directly on the consumption of Shrek to keep generating royalties.

I'm your host Ann Berry and in this session, we are getting the lowdown or the down low on the high end luxury retail market and diving into the businesses of Hermes and LVMH. With us now is Marie Driscoll, Senior Analyst at Coresight Research to unpack their business models a little further. Marie, thank you so much for joining today.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThank you for having me. It's an honor and a privilege.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMarie, can you just talk about - super high level just to paint the picture for us - the current state of the luxury retail market and how it has been impacted by inflation and a slowing growth outlook?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSure. So this is 2023. New Year, new time. The last few years, you know just to recap, luxury really skyrocketed during COVID luxury products are the most experiential of all products. And while people were locked in, unable to travel, unable to eat out their lives somewhat constrained, they sought luxury products and a lot of people had additional income because you weren't spending on experiences. So luxury became the new experience. And in fact, the luxury market captured a lot of new consumers. As we ended 2022, there's still you know, in America, there's a lot of pent up demand for travel. We were traveling last year to Europe where you saw lots of luxury purchases transpire in Europe, where in 2021, many of them, and in 2020, they occurred in the US market. The U.S. market took over as the number one market in the last few years where it had been like China are the number one consumers it moved to America. We've seen a lot of shifting happen in the last few years. So as we enter this year, you have a shift back to experiences which consumers want to have, they want to travel and travel has inflationary prices of 25 to 50%. Consumers want to eat out, there's inflation across the board, and the economy is somewhat weakening. So that's one backdrop that's happening.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAt the same time, though, you have the China market opening up. We saw that happen in February. China was really under a lockdown last year so luxury really suffered. So as the Chinese began to travel domestically, and then as this year and next year progressed internationally, they will resume their – we assume they'll resume their love affair with all things luxury. So the big things as we head into this year are the pace of the reopening of China post the pandemic and what was a dampened demand for China for luxury by the Chinese is that resume. And then what's happening in the U.S. economy, there's mounting job losses with the Vigilant fed fighting inflation. The stock market is volatile, and these are factors that impact consumer sentiment and their willingness to spend on discretionary purchases.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut as I said, during COVID, we got a lot of new luxury shoppers. It's projected that by 2030, about 75% or more of all luxury purchases will be made by millennials and younger. You have a lot of people that discovered luxury and luxury is sticky. Luxury is better quality. It romances people. It impacts the way people think about themselves. And we believe that they'll be trading down in some more commodity type products, like in the brown beans that you buy, maybe in the jeans that you buy.\u0026nbsp; In apparel, we see a trade down, but luxury we think has stickiness. That said, you know, if you lose your job, you're not going to be buying luxury products.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Let's talk about stickiness, mobile, let's also talk about it in the context of pricing. I feel as though there are constantly these articles being published about how Rolex watches Hermes bags, have seen prices skyrocket under the guise of inflation in part but also because demand seems to have gone up from these new demographics. Can you talk about how price sensitive or not luxury is? Not all luxury is created equal if you break it down by category for us?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e No, no. So not all luxury is created equal and I mean, the real trick of luxury and really any product category is to best match supply and demand. With luxury you want to have demand outpacing supply. And that's what happened during COVID. More people wanted an Hermes handbag or wanted an Hermes bracelet. Then Hermes was able to meet that demand. Some of it was supply chain constraints, and some of that there were more people entering the market that wanted these things.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou also see that in resale if you're a student of the markets, you see that resale has provided pricing transparency into your first purchase. So you could buy a Hermes handbag newer or\u0026nbsp; Louis Vuitton handbag new and see that in the aftermarket, you can get 80 to 150% of what you paid for. So it's brought a new kind of shopper into the market. Also, if you buy in consignment it is where you can often meet that need for a luxury product today. You don't have to wait six months for it. It's In the aftermarket.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNot all products are equal. Certainly Hermes is, you know, unique in its ability to keep consumers panting for demand of you know their Birkin bag or their Kelly bag. But, and you've seen while Gucci was really driving incredible demand through COVID. By the end of COVID. Really, it became.. it was time to move on to another product. So partly as luxury becomes entwined with high priced designer brands, designer design and fashion are different than true luxury.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd let's talk a little bit about where Hermes and LVMH specifically fall on the luxury pricing spectrum. Marie, do you expect the higher end brands like there to be more recession proof than mid tier luxury brands? I mean, as you look at overall demand as distinct printers, price sensitivity, where do you see those learned?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThere are two different companies. Hermes has this one brand with sub-brands. Birkin is a brand, but it's really one brand, Louis Vuitton is a company that consists of about 80 different luxury brands. So with LVMH you're getting incredible diversification that spans Sephora and beauty, which is our entry points for luxury and in fact is holding up quite well. DFS, which is another part of their selective retail group. But they have some real winners with Louisville Vuitton and Christian Dior and then they have some more fashion brands like a Kenzo that are more vulnerable to an economy than the LDN, then the Louis Vuitton. And then of course, you have Tiffany's, you have all their jewelry lines.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo what we saw in 2008 and 2009, is that luxury did not go down as low as other categories and it rebounded more quickly than other consumer discretionary categories. And we think that that will be the case again, this, you know, in this current economic environment, and frankly, this environment is nowhere near what 2008 or 2009 was with the Great Recession. Right now, like we're not even sure if we're in a recession, right? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnne Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMarie, yes. So I think we're not sure if we're in a recession now and it's much more about the outlook. You've talked about Asia demand. Let's call it something else geopolitically that's different today versus in 2008 and that's the impact on Russian demand for luxury goods. Talk to us a little bit about what demand from Russia has looked like in the past and where it stands now, given the conflict with Ukraine?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight. So Russia, it is not a support as it was in 2008 or2009. Or, you know, it was part of the picture. But now you have a growing UAE, you have a youth that is entering the luxury market. And so I think that, you know, what's different now is there's more people in the market. We recently presented a Shop talk and in 2000, when we entered this century, 3% of the Chinese were in the middle class, by 2018 53% were. I mean, you have a huge middle class of 700 million people that buy luxury. They may buy low, and they have pent up demand from COVID for the last two years. So that's going to help them this year. The UAE has always sought luxury, but now they're bringing it to their own territory and we see a lot of demand coming there, which will offset the loss of the Russian consumer.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTalk to us a little bit too, Marie, about direct to consumer and how luxury has been able to sell online, you know, you think about the stereotypical luxury experience, it's very much in person, it's tactile, you see the product, you feel the product, you try the product, if you're paying such high prices, has that evolved?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo their pricing is consistent, you know, the luxury brands are going direct to consumer because they can, they're in selected points of distribution where they want to be often they're renting space in a wonderful department store like a Bergdorf Goodman, and Neiman Marcus or Saks Fifth Avenue or Bloomingdale's. But going direct to consumer means that you hope that you have control of your messaging at all points, and your adjacencies.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDuring COVID we saw and we continue to see throughout America, that luxury brands are opening more direct to consumer out physical stores to be where the consumer is because during COVID many consumers moved from metro areas to urban and rural areas. We just did a survey in China and it's more important for the Chinese that they want to discover luxury in physical store locations. And another interesting facet is that they're influenced more by their friends than they are by a KOL. So I urge you folks to check out Coresight’s research and look for our most recent survey on the China luxury consumer. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut so, but direct to consumer is just a way for them to really control what they look like in every point of sale and online. You can get selected products but luxury, is experiential, as you said, and not all the apparel is going to be or the ready to wear, not all the collection is going to be available online. But it's as easy as during COVID the consumers picked up the phone and call their sales associate. And and they were doing one to one selling kind of like one to one live shopping.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMarie, just to finish our conversation, which has been just so interesting. With respect to Hermes and LVMH in particular, can we just go back to something you touched on early, which was the second hand market? We know that both Hermes and LVMH generate about half their revenue from the leather goods category, which is one secondhand market? And then you've got jewelry and others? Can you talk about the second hand appetite for those different product categories?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, so I know better the second hand you know, the RealReal's of the world, the best year collective. A lot of it is the leather goods, you know, if you're a shopper and you love luxury goods and you buy some luxury clothing, you see that it drops, unless it's the most iconic of pieces, it drops in value, like 50 to 80%. The handbags hold their value, as I said before, and you get 80 to 150% of what you pay for. The thing about the secondhand market is that you can attract a new consumer to your brand there. A lot of brands, luxury, contemporary are bringing resale on their own branded platform so that they can keep that connection with the consumer. And there's been advances in technology and tagging so that luxury brands can keep track of who owns their product.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAll this is to say that secondhand is really very viable. A luxury shopper cares about sustainability. And this secondhand is a feature of sustainability. It shows a prolonged life, it validates a purchase and it validates quality, something that has an extended life. An interesting feature that has come out with the recent RealReal report is that consumers are looking for vintage products and they're looking for handbags that are in fair condition, not necessarily in excellent condition because they want a handbag with the patina of use, which is really interesting. They want to look like they've owned this handbag for 10 years not for you know the last month. Interesting, right?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThat is very interesting.\u0026nbsp; And part of my last question, which comes to mind if you can get your crystal ball out for us, Marie, and look at the next six to 12 months out? How do you see that trend evolving? And what are some other evolving consumer and luxury retail trends you can see coming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo I think luxury holds up. I think that, you know, depending on how bad the economy is, you will see an impact. It's more muted in luxury but it you know it does participate in the economy. I think you'll see perhaps people trading into second hand also monetizing what they have in their closet to support their next luxury purchase.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAdditionally, beauty will do well. Beauty has become a form of wellness, it's a form of taking care of oneself. So all the and fragrance has become more important in terms of self expression and taking care of oneself. So I think that we're going to see beauty grow, and you see that caring brings beauty in house. So beauty will become a more important feature of overall luxury and luxury will hold up and luxury has less volatile earnings and they can sooner you know, slow down their manufacturing and again keep their supply demand that equation in balance.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWith that Marie Driscoll thank you so much for joining us Senior Analyst at Coresight Research.

Welcome, everyone. Welcome to the Alts show. I'm your host, Calum Johnson, and today is a very exciting day. Alts are officially live on Public - over 25 alternative assets that you can choose from and trade in the platform currently. I encourage everyone on the call to check it out. But to help us talk about some of these assets and what this all means, we're joined by Dylan Dittrich and Adam Katz, who heads up research at alternative investment analysis platform Altan Insights, and we also have Leah Smith, who leads acquisitions here on the Public alts team. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe're excited to chat about the offerings that just opened up for trading on Public.com today. Okay, so let's get straight into it. First off, I want to zoom out a bit and start with a general overview. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, Leah, I'm going to send it to you first. Can you quickly just walk us through what we mean when we refer to alts on Public, and why someone would want to consider investing in them? What are some of the risks or so to be aware of?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLeah Smith: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhen we say alternative assets at Public, we mean investments outside of traditional asset classes, like stocks, and cash in our terms, we also mean outside of crypto. The largest categories within alternative investments are typically real estate and private equity. Otis previously focused mostly on cultural assets. So the offerings that you're seeing today on Public are primarily in those kinds of collectible art, sports memorabilia categories. We have every intention of expanding soon, though, in a lot of exciting ways, which I'm sure we will cover at a later date on a different Alts live. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo often people invest in these alternatives because, you know, it's a way of diversifying and also sometimes, you know, peeking into your personal interest. So, ultra-high-net-worth individuals allocate about 5% to collectibles and then larger allotments for real estate and private equity. Many of these categories also perform well against the S\u0026amp;P. The biggest hurdle, you know, in the past was really access. And that's part of why we're so excited to be part of Public now. And again, you know, diversification is the name of the game. That's why a lot of people focus on alts, in general. So, because there are, you know, many categories that perform well against the S\u0026amp;P, there are also risks. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn many of these categories, there's less liquidity, there's volatility, and some of the asset categories within the overarching alternative space are even kind of more especially volatile, volatile, like NFTs for example. And then, as with everything, you know, we encourage everyone to do their own research and make sure that the kind of risk-reward profile of your portfolio fits with what you're looking to achieve.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThanks for the context, Leah. I want to open this up and get Adam and Dylan involved here. Obviously, you guys cover this space very, very closely. Could you just give our audience a brief overview of what's been happening broadly in the collectible space? And then, what are some of the big trends and developments that we're seeing at the moment?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDylan, I know you're kind of a regular on the show at this point. Let's start with you, and then We can go to Adam.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat, thanks, Calum, thanks for having me back on. So really, in the collectibles and cultural asset worlds, we're coming off of, you know, two years in 2020 and 2021, that we're overall incredibly kind years to collectibles. And that was fueled by a variety of factors, you know, yes, time inside and enduring lockdowns, kind of laid a foundation for nostalgic pursuits and people being reintroduced to collecting habits that had gone dormant. But, you know, as we're learning, perhaps more important than the time inside was really the injection of both fiscal and monetary stimulus into the mainstream investing public, with the government kind of stepping in to backstop the economy, to support the economy. Market participants were very quickly given the confidence to continue to invest and maybe even a rational level of confidence to start speculating financially. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd you fast forward to today, and we're in this very different situation where inflation is roaring, and kind of the very firm messaging from the government has been, you know, they're not necessarily stepping in to prevent economic weakness this time around. And so as a result of that, signaling, traditional financial markets, so your stocks and bonds have both kind of been pummeled over the last few months. And that is kind of spreading into many collectible markets, many cultural asset markets, you know, when people start to feel uncertain or uneasy about the economy, they're less inclined to take risks with money. But what's interesting about that, though, is while all that's going on, you know, the whale collectors and investors, the ultra-high net worth individuals, they're impacted a little bit less by this kind of short-term macroeconomic force. So well, collectible markets kind of broadly have been falling, you have still been seeing these huge headlines of multimillion-dollar record sales across asset classes, you know, whether it's sports cards, memorabilia, comic books, there are still huge prices - prices that have never been seen before being paid for the best of the best assets. And that's what makes the idea of democratization of those assets an attractive one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCool. Adam, do you want to come in here as well?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdam Katz: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, and thanks for having me back. Dylan just gave a really terrific overview of the kind of macro environment over the last couple of years. And just mentioned that at the top of the market, there have been some enormous record-setting sales. The 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle sold for over $12 million, setting a record recently. And what you're seeing beyond just the fact that the top-of-the-top sort of the Grails in collectibles, beyond those performing really well, I would say that the more established categories within collectibles have been outperforming the newer ones.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eFor people who want to stay in collectibles, that might mean shifting from more speculative modern-day sports cards to vintage sports cards or higher-graded sports cards. And we've seen beyond sports cars memorabilia, things like blue-chip art and wine, which have been in the market for a lot longer than things like video games or NFTs. Those are performed a lot better. And some of them have even gone up even as we've seen the stock market go down. Collectibles are not just one category that acts in concert with each other. There are so many subcategories that have had such different histories that you kind of have to approach them individually. So when you're looking at art or wine, it's going to be different than, as I said, video games or NFTs.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNo, and I think that sets it up really well for our audience. I think a lot of the community on Public is obviously more familiar with stocks. And that's why to both Dylan and Adam - I'm kind of curious to get deeper into the valuing and the pricing of some of these categories. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan you kind of just speak about some of the dynamics, some of the influences that kind of gauge how these categories interact and the valuing and the pricing that we see there? Dylan, we can start with you/\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSure. So as you kind of alluded to, you know, with stocks or bonds, they generally have, you know, underlying cash flows or business prospects that make it easier and kind of more tangible to arrive at a valuation. And there's a greater level of assurance and confidence around, you know, kind of the risk involved in the valuation bands into which something could trade – and with collectibles and cultural assets, that's not really the case, right? And so what you're really relying on, to kind of inform value, is the interplay between supply and demand, and how those two forces are shaped and how they can change over time. And, you know, it sounds simple enough kind of at face value, but it's actually pretty, pretty complex. You know, a lot of the very most valuable collectible assets have very low supply, and importantly, that supply isn't likely to grow. But what's so important is recognizing that low supply alone is not enough to make something valuable, right? You need that other component, the demand. When you have kind of this very low, basically, a movable supply, matched with strong demand and the right demand, deep-pocketed demand, that's when you have a recipe for high values. You know, is this the kind of asset that would draw museum-quality collectors? Is it the kind of asset that wouldn't be out of place, you know, headlining an auction successfully at a Sotheby's or Christie's?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd when you think about those two forces, supply and demand, you want to think about, like, what's the time horizon over which you're thinking about those because, you know, if you're short term, and you're looking to make a short term play on an asset, you're looking for, you know, a very sharp uptick in demand and a very short amount of time. Or maybe you're looking to kind of expose an inefficiency in the market where, you know, something is trading at a price that's nowhere near where it would sell at auction or in a private sale. So you're looking for very short-term movement in one of those two forces. When you're long-term, you're thinking about it differently. You're thinking, you know, how does demand change over the course of years or decades? You know, and you start thinking about demographic shifts. You know, who's coming into money or entering their peak earning years? And what do they care about? What are they going to be spending money on? What are they going to be collecting? What kind of inspires nostalgia for them? And is it the same or different from a previous generation? And if it's different, is the market pricing that in yet, and so there's kind of it at face value, very simple kind of framework through which to view these assets, but there's a lot of complex complexity that comes with it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAdam, you want to come in here as well?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdam Katz: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, so I'll just expand on what Dylan just mentioned about nostalgia. I mean, that's a huge driving force in a lot of these asset classes, you know, we're not talking about a rational market with cash flows or, you know, revenue numbers that you can value these assets on, people have very strong connections and emotions to pop culture or sports figures. And it's not just about whether it's a good investment; it's whether they want to own this item. And especially when you're seeing fractionalization of these items and the ability for everyday investors to get pieces of these really special and rare items.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eFor a lot of people, it's not just about the investment, it's about being able to say that you own a piece of this thing or that you own this whole thing. And just in the first couple hours, that these assets have been live on Public, I've been kind of following the buying and selling and I've just noticed that things like the Pokemon card, the Charizard card and the Harry Potter book, which are square in that demographic of people who are on Public, those things are eliciting strong emotions. And those things have seen a lot of activity so far compared to some of the other assets. So it is about figuring out both what is rare and what has high quality, but it's also trying to understand what the rest of the market is going to desire.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd then I also just wanted to briefly talk about liquidity. I'm sure you know, Public users who are used to the equities market are used to being able to buy and sell immediately at the market price. You know, there's going to be a lot of buyers and sellers for these things. In collectibles. and in alts. that's not necessarily going to be the case. It's not gonna be the same kind of liquidity you see on the equities markets, and sometimes they're going to be fairly large bid-ask spreads. So it's not just saying, oh, I want to buy this Harry Potter book; it's deciding what you think. It's worth maybe putting a bid in and then having some patience until that gets filled. And similarly, on the sell side, it's the same thing, you might not be able to sell it immediately.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u0026nbsp;think that's a really good overview and kind of an insight into the nuances between stocks, and then collectibles and these alternative assets. And I kind of want to go deeper into one of the things you mentioned, which is a great point that when you're evaluating a stock, it's usually based on a business. So you can look at the earnings report, you can look at the revenue numbers, the profit, and different quantifiable metrics. A lot of these alternative asset categories are based around nostalgia and people's emotional attachment, which is just difficult, more difficult to quantify.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI'm curious, when you guys are writing up a report or researching an asset or doing some of this analysis, what is your process? What kind of metrics and things are you looking at? And are there any specific frameworks that you use to come up with like a determination on the value of an asset? Dylan, we can kick over to you again.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSure, I think, you know, you want to approach an asset through both a short-term and a long-term lens. So, you know, when you're looking at the valuation of an asset today, you want to be wary of things like comparable sales for that asset. Has the same asset or very similar assets, have those been sold at auction recently? And what does the trajectory look like for those sales? You know, have they been trending up, and there's reason to believe that that could continue, and you're not just catching the top? Are they falling, and there's reason to believe that, you know, the slide could be reversed? Or are you, you know, catching a falling knife? And so, you know, looking at very similar sales is part of that from a short-term perspective. But as you're kind of expanding your time horizon, you really want to be thinking about, you know, what are assets that maybe aren't precisely similar but are in some ways comparable, and how are they trading? What does their valuation look like? You know, is it greater than or less than the asset you're studying? And should that be the case based on a variety of factors, like, you know, how rare the asset is, how culturally relevant it is, and how culturally relevant it might be in the future based on demographic trends, and you know, how audiences are growing and falling.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd so, you know, you really want to kind of both address those kinds of very, very short-term matters to ensure you're getting an evaluation, that's, that's, you know, reasonable in the short term, but also start thinking beyond that, to think, you know, where does this asset go in the next 10 years, and what drives it there, and what brings a bigger audience, for demand to kind of build the, you know, the buyer pool for that type of asset. So, you really want to be able to view it through both of those lenses and be able to kind of extrapolate data across different assets in different asset classes, rely on historical data from other categories to show how different assets of similar stature have risen or fallen over time. That's the way I like to approach it, both from that short-term and that long-term perspective.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay, very interesting. Adam, I'm gonna kick it over to you.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdam Katz: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eComparable sales are often if you find a deer comp, you know, you're looking at a card and the same card and the same gray, same I've just sold, I mean, that's gonna be fairly easy valuation books most the time, unfortunately, not that easy is still instead, you also have to consider the trajectory, you know, the long the short term trend of that player or that type of asset or that artist versus the most recent trend of that asset class as a whole. And whether or not this thing is a true Grail, meaning, you know, one of the top assets within this class, or whether it's not a more run of the mill, because both short-term and long term. In the long-term outlook, what is going to affect demand? Are there going to be catalysts for a greater cultural significance of this item? You know, is this comic book going to be made into a movie? Is this player for this card? Is this person going to be a championship contender? Or if they're retired? Are they going to make the Hall of Fame? You know, are there discrete events that could potentially push this item into the public eye, which then will increase demand probably more short term than long term? But surely, you will see things like I just mentioned that will boost demand and, therefore, boost prices for things canceled.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay, great. And I think it's, I think it's an interesting point about how events and these kinds of landmark moments can also influence value and pricing. I know even back a couple of years ago when the last dance documentary came out about Jordan, we kind of saw a rise in value in some of his memorabilia and trading cards. So I think it's definitely an interesting thing for people to keep in mind. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLeah, I want to bring you back in here because I know that you obviously do a ton of research and analysis when you're making acquisitions for Public for the Alts team; how, what is, what is your process? And then, I guess, how does it differ, if at all, from some of the things that Dylan and Adam explained from how they do things?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLeah Smith: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo everything that both Dylan Dylan and Adam have mentioned, we definitely look at it, I think it's a lot about, you know, category and subcategory-specific context. So if we're looking at cards, we take into account, obviously, you know, comparable sales and grading and pop reports. And then there are the added layers of some of the more qualitative stuff like, you know, or not even necessarily qualitative, but who's the player? What's their legacy? Or if it's a newer player, what are their projections?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIt's everything that Dylan and Adam have mentioned, with the additional kind of layer of not just kind of broad demand. So in that way, it's different than, you know, finding a singular buyer at an auction in that kind of analysis that goes into something like that. And more, you know, is this going to resonate with, with a larger group of people who, who is this going to be most relevant for? So I think, you know, I think it was Dylan's point who said that there were a couple of the assets that have migrated over today that have seen, you know, some significant activity. And because, I would agree, you know, that it's squarely in that sort of demographic. So I would say that we.. the added layer of considering who we would be making this acquisition for which audience is a really important one that we, you know, bake into our analysis after we do all of the normal kind of investment analysis.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNo, that's really, that's really helpful. context. And, you know, I think because, obviously, alts have launched today, one thing I definitely wanted to get all of your take on was, and we can go around the room with this, what is kind of your favorite asset that you're looking at right now, and you're excited about? Obviously putting it out there that this is not investment advice for anyone that's in the audience. But yeah, I would love to hear some of the assets you guys are excited about that have launched today. Dylan, we can start with you.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNice. Yeah. So I'm a sneaker guy at heart. So I've always been intrigued by the Shattered Backboard Air Jordan 1 on the platform. So a little quick, quick backstory - this is the sneaker Michael Jordan wore, Air Jordan 1, when he was playing an exhibition game over in Italy. He went up to dunk and shattered the backboard, effectively ending the game. And these are the sneakers from that exact moment. I think there's even glass in the soul of the sneaker. At one point, this was the single most expensive pair of sneakers ever sold at auction when it sold n August 2020 for $615,000.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eInterestingly enough, some of the Public investors have beaten me to the punch on this one. This was one of the assets that popped higher today. I think the market cap is somewhere in the neighborhood of where it sold at auction two years ago. But it's interesting, I mean, right now, you have huge headline sales in blue chip game Warren memorabilia. Michael Jordan's jersey from game one of the 1998 finals just sold two weeks ago for $10.1 million. So you know, you can see there is increased demand for a worn pair of Jordan 1s that have really strong provenance that's photo matched. And, you know, that alone would make this asset cool. But the fact is, it also inspired that moment, inspired one of the most kind of iconic Jordan colorways, the Shattered Backboard colorway, which is white, orange, and black and nods to the uniform that Jordan was wearing that day. So it's a colorway Nike is still using all the time and nodding to across different models. So just a really cool asset. And I think not investment advice, but definitely, a cool one to see democratized in this way.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eVery cool. And I love that one as well. Adam, do you want to step in here? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdam Katz: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSure. I have shares in a few of these assets as well, so I won't mention any of those. But I'm excited about them. One thing that kept an eye on for a long time, Mr. Wiley, is one of my favorite artists in speaking of, you know, emotional connection, personal connection, nostalgia, I would love to own a fork in him no Wiley painting at some point in my life. But for now, you know, the ability to have access to get shares of that is pretty incredible. Artwork is something that doesn't get as much attention. But I think it's great that there are those options on Public because it has been an asset class with a long history and a long history of performing really well, and honestly, I'd love to see more work on the platform.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay, amazing. And Leah, I like that we have one sneaker, we have one pair of art, Leah, I'm going to let you kind of round it out, finish it off.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLeah Smith: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, so again, this is not investment advice. And this is coming from somebody who's been sometimes very, very close, literally, physically, to the assets themselves. So, you know, I would say I am on the complete same page with Adam and Dylan for those two assets. But one of my personal favorites is Harry Potter. It's just such a huge cornerstone story for an entire generation. And that generation is also, you know, having kids, and I think that first book, getting to see it in person, even myself, It was so exciting, and it's just a really important asset. I think it has launched, you know, multiple generations now of readers and a huge media franchise, and I think it's just a, it's a really great example of the book as well. So that's mine always.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLeah, just on that, before I get to the final question, can you give a bit more of the context around that asset? I know that there were only about 500 copies of that first edition book. And there's kind of an interesting, just context around why that specific book is so special.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLeah Smith: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSure. So I think a lot of people know, but if you don't, you know, JK Rowling had a hard time finding a publisher initially for Harry Potter and that story. And so there was a publisher out of London called Bloomsbury that took a risk and printed 500 books, about half of which went to libraries and the other half of which went to bookstores. There are a couple of typos, including one on the back cover, I want to say if memory serves. And this is, being that it's already a really, really limited supply of 500 and being that half of those, you know, went to libraries, the chances of any of those books surviving in readable condition are relatively slim.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut as far as context goes, there are just enough that you know, every once in a while, you'll see something come to auction. So in a lot of ways, it's almost like a perfect example asset for us just because there's just enough context to undo or stand, you know, pricing and comps and things like that. But it also is just so culturally, hugely relevant. And there's no more of those first 500 ever coming out again or being printed again. So that's why I think it's such an interesting asset that checks a lot of boxes for us.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eReally cool. And I think it just goes to serve how there are such interesting stories behind each of these individual assets. Okay, so here's where I want to end with the final question. Today, we've obviously launched with collectibles, NFTs, and fine art. I know that we're planning to bring more kind of asset categories to the platform and give people even more exposure and opportunity to diversify their portfolios.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI want to go around the room here. Are there any kind of asset categories that you have in mind that you would be very excited for Public to potentially bring on the platform? Maybe if it's not asset categories, it's a specific asset? Just kind of interested to get your guys' thoughts on that. And Dylan, I'll kick it back over to you to start.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, I think they're, they're kind of two audiences, two fan bases that are somewhat underrepresented in the, in the collectibles world. So I'd definitely be interested to see either some movie memorabilia or music memorabilia introduced to the platform. There have been some really cool pieces that have shown up at auction over the years of, you know, handwritten lyrics to iconic songs that draw, you know, high six-figure, low seven-figure sums. And they're really cool relics that kind of show that artistic process and the evolution of something that goes on to become very celebrated and very famous. And, you know, I think music fan bases, music audiences are very passionate and very engaged. So always game to see those kinds of things more represented fractionally as well.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay, awesome - those are two really cool ones. Adam, do you also want to come in here as well?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdam Katz: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, totally agree with Dylan. I think that those would be super cool asset classes to add. For me, I am definitely interested in seeing wine and spirits. People have been investing in wine for a long table, and it has historically been a relatively stable asset class in a lot of ways than some of the others that are represented on the platform already. I also think that it appeals to a different kind of user than some of the assets that are there already. And I think that there are a lot of really awesome high-end whiskies that have been selling recently at auction. And I would love to see some of that on there. And for a more specific asset, if you could get that Aaron Judge 62nd home run, if and when that happens. I mean, that would be pretty awesome.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, that's it. That's a big one. Leah, do you want to finish it off?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLeah Smith: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, we actually do have an offer out on the final judge, home run, but I know that there's a 2 million offer right now on the 62. So we're on the same page, Adam, hopefully, one day we'll get there.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI think, you know, part of me is a little torn because I don't want to give away too much of, you know, some exciting stuff that's to come. But I think there's so much exciting stuff around movie and music, memorabilia, wine and spirits too, of course, but I think within income generating alternatives too, that's where I'd also be really excited to bring some stuff to Public members to be able to invest in and, and kind of, you know, grow and play along with. So I don't want to give away too much, but I do want to say that there's a lot of expansion coming, and it's all really exciting. I'm biased, obviously. But I think there's a lot of fun stuff on the horizon.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, for sure. And I'm definitely inclined to agree. I think the cash-flowing, cash-generating assets are really interesting, like the royalties, the real estate, all of that. But yeah, it's been an amazing show. Thank you. Thank you to all our guests for coming on and giving that breakdown in that context.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","eventType":"PUBLIC_LIVE","assetCategorization":["ALTS"],"sponsorDetailsDto":null,"audienceCohort":"ALL_MEMBERS","hosts":[{"publicId":"d0b2d87d-5846-4b13-800d-7b9e62c33559","username":"calumjohnson1","displayName":"Calum Johnson","profilePictureURL":"https://prod-api.154310543964.hellopublic.com/static/users/images/kUJQinOxEGImVVSsF17ud352BcYVJvTT-thumbnail-300x300.jpg","verified":true,"isPrivate":false,"bio":"Marketing Manager at Public|Host of the Public Live Alts Show\n|All opinions are my own, not investment advice","followedByMe":false,"following":false},{"publicId":"923b27b7-1c24-484a-8817-ccd8dfb7bed9","username":"leahalts","displayName":"Leah Smith","profilePictureURL":"https://prod-api.154310543964.hellopublic.com/static/users/images/FrtxHePMAFuQTZUt7aNkO9g58sIJlKRe-thumbnail-300x300.jpg","verified":true,"isPrivate":false,"bio":null,"followedByMe":false,"following":false},{"publicId":"1d0da544-2faf-479c-80b0-18d1fa1289cd","username":"adamkatz","displayName":"Adam Katz","profilePictureURL":"https://prod-api.154310543964.hellopublic.com/static/users/images/53n9JuDpO1VRSCLV5atTSM8ChhFVGLLX-thumbnail-300x300.jpg","verified":false,"isPrivate":false,"bio":"Adam Katz (@AdamKatzWriter) is the Head of Research for Vincent.

Welcome to Alts, my name is Calum and I’m your host. This show is all about alternative investing and emerging trends happening at the intersection of culture and investing. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe have a very exciting show today because we're going to be giving you a bit of a preview of how alts investing is going to work on Public. So to be clear, alts won't be launching until later this month, on Public, but we thought it made sense to start educating our community on the details of how these new assets work on the public platform. Because it's quite a new product that differs in many ways from stocks and crypto, that you're all familiar with. So to that end, we've brought in Keith Marshall, who leads the alts team here at Public to break down everything for us. Keith, welcome to the show. Can you give the audience a quick introduction into who you are, and then how you got into alts?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Marshall: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSure, thing. Thanks, Calum. Great to meet everyone. I'm Keith Marshall, the GM of the Alts team here at Public. I'm an attorney by trade and was the General Counsel at Otis, which I'll talk more about in a minute. I also happen to personally love all things alts though from art, to wine to NFTs and pretty much anything in this category. I've collected wine and art for years now. The wine collection is small, and I mostly enjoyed drinking it, but that's beside the fact. On the NFT side, I've been playing around for about two years now and I'm pretty deep in crypto as well. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI can and do talk about this stuff literally all day. So I'll do my best to keep these responses to the point as best I can. I mentioned Otis, though, as a reminder for everyone, Public acquired Otis earlier this year. And it's an incredibly exciting new chapter for us where we're basically taking the vision of Otis and bringing alts to a much larger audience here at Public. The acquisition is overall part of Public’s strategy to redefine the modern portfolio and make public markets work for everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay, amazing. Thanks for the intro. I want to start here and just with understanding the assets themselves, and what the Public community will actually be able to invest in. So when we talk about alternative assets on Public, can you just give us a bit more detail? What type of assets are we specifically talking about?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Marshall: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo as a category, stepping back, alternative assets generally refers to anything besides extreme exchange listed stocks, ETFs, bonds, cash and sometimes crypto. On Public specifically, though, alts is a much narrower subset. They are securities that represent fractional ownership of assets like art, collectibles, and NFTs. Broadly, we call them cultural assets. Over time, though, the goal is to broaden our categories available for investment to include a much more diverse selection of alts on Public. We plan to look at things that produce cash flows, like music, royalties, real estate, we might even do things like private equity and venture capital. But again, a super important reminder on Public, these are actually interests in a legal entity that owns an asset, not the assets themselves, like you might see on Stock X.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSuper cool, and especially when we start talking about real estate and music royalties, I think it really gets cool, and it gets very exciting. I want to take it even a step further back. Why would people potentially be interested in investing in these types of assets? Why should they make it part of their portfolios?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Marshall: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo alternative assets are increasingly becoming part of a modern diversified investment portfolio. Historically, this has mostly been led by high net worth individuals, even back to a 2020 survey shows that they allocate around 5% to collectibles alone, and even bigger numbers to private equity and real estate. So our goal is to bring some of these assets to a much broader group of people, not just that super small .01, .1% of the population. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd the reason for this is that alt assets have historically performed pretty well over time as compared to the S\u0026amp;P. The lawyer in me is screaming past performance is not indicative of future results. Sorry, had to say that, but timing is everything here. Anyway, there are a growing number of sources too, that just point to certain alternative assets having really low correlation with traditional asset classes, meaning they're again part of a diversified investment portfolio, and some can even be seen as a hedge against inflation, partially through diversifying your portfolio. TLDR - you should never put all of your eggs in one basket and alts are a different type of egg that you can put in your basket If it fits for you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay, perfect. And I love that you always have the lawyer hotline as well. I'm curious from a legal standpoint, how did these once these assets are acquired? How do they actually become investable shares that are then accessible to the public community.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Marshall: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe term fractionalization is thrown around pretty frequently. But the concept really means for us holding an asset in a legal entity. So to start, we're identifying and potentially securing or purchasing a specific asset or group of assets that can be outright purchase, consignment, or even just identifying a broad category like floor Bored Ape NFTs. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe then form a Delaware entity to eventually hold the asset. After that asset is identified, we form a company, then we file a document, really a set of documents with the SEC, that will, with SEC approval, allow that company to offer securities representing this fractional ownership of the asset. These offering documents are incredibly robust include pages and pages of risk factors and things about the investment itself and investing in alts generally. So you've got this document that describes the entity, describes the asset. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe third piece is the financials, because these are again, separate companies. So each eventually gets its own set of audited financial statements. And there's even a confirmation by an independent auditor, that we actually hold the asset we say we hold. And it's worth mentioning that you may have read about fractionalization through NFTs, for example, like buying an NF t that represents a fractional portion of the trading card. This is not what we're doing. I would strongly caution investors to do a ton of research, because those particular assets might not be going through the U.S. securities law framework, which adds a huge layer of risk. Instead, we're going with a more tried and true path that has the SEC putting their eyes on things.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat - and I definitely echo that. Always do your research before you get involved with anything like this. I want to step into the shoes of the Public member who's considering potentially investing in an alt when they become available on Public. I'm curious - so when you invest in an alt on Public, what is it that you're actually investing or buying shares into? Can you just give a bit more detail on that?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Marshall: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSure, it's a similar concept to buying a share of Tesla or Apple or Google, except that it happens to be a legal entity tied to a specific asset. So as I mentioned before, you're buying securities that represent a fractional interest in a given asset, not the asset itself. In our current structure, you are technically becoming the holder of membership interests in a limited liability company. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor ease, I'll call the shares and the company I'll refer to interchangeably as an asset, mostly because aside from me, most people think of the underlying asset, like Shattered Backboard sneakers, not the name of the legal entity. So the sole purpose of that legal entity is to hold this actual asset. And to drive this point home as best I can, a great example is you can't exchange the shares you hold for the asset itself, you are literally holding a legal interest in the entity that holds the asset.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay, perfect. And thank you for that context. I know, even when we were at Otis, and now coming over to Public and alts coming to Public, a big discussion is around liquidity around alts. So can you just give the audience and everyone a refresher on, first of all, what is liquidity? And then why is it important to think about liquidity when it comes to investing in alts on Public?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Marshall: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo I'll step back even higher at first. I mean, the main point of the acquisition of Otis by Public was to increase liquidity overall for the specific asset classes. So liquidity is basically the speed and ease with which you can exit a given investment. Basically, how can you get the cash value of your investment? Or what is your ability to convert the shares you hold back to cash quickly and at a price that's acceptable to you? We generally talk about liquidity from the sellers perspective, although of course liquidity affects buyers as well because it means there needs to be liquidity for you to actually buy something and enter a position. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo an asset like an exchange listed stock, like a Tesla, or Google that you'd find on NASDAQ, or the New York Stock Exchange, those are highly liquid. Those are large markets with tons of participants, all across different platforms. Conversely, you have assets like private equity interests, they're highly illiquid. There's generally no market for investments like that, and you may not even have a means to sell them outside of the fund being wound down, for example. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo for alts on Public, the market is limited to Public itself, meaning members of Public are buying and selling amongst each other. This is really different from exchange listed stocks, and even crypto where there are marketplaces outside of the public ecosystem. This means that, you know, alts on Public are going to have lower liquidity than traditional exchange listed stocks. But again, the hope is for Public to make these asset classes substantially more liquid than before, and bring these markets to a much more mature level than they are today. On an asset by asset basis, you'll also see varying levels of liquidity, depending on public members willingness to buy or sell.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay, perfect. And I think, to your point, it's something that's very important for Public members to consider when they're investing in alts is, does the liquidity fit with the time horizon and their investment goals? That's something to consider before you get into it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOkay, great. So we've kind of covered the big picture things. I'd love to get more into the nitty gritty logistics of how Public members will actually be able to buy and sell shares and these assets on the app. So could you kind of just give us an overview of the different stages of the investing process into alts?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Marshall: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eFor sure. So first, there's an initial offering, which I briefly mentioned before - at that stage, you are purchasing shares directly from this company that holds the asset, there's one price and a set number of shares are sold at this given price. Then we go through a four to six week administrative closing period, where we take all of the investments in the initial offering, tick and tie everything together, and officially close it in air quotes. So the securities at that point, can be bought and sold between public members in trading. And trading between public members just means that people are literally buying and selling amongst each other. This is what we will be launching very, very soon in the next few weeks. Initial offerings will happen on the Public platform, hopefully later this year or early next year.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay, nice. So you really alluded to it, but just to make it clear for everyone, the first alts that are offered on Public are not going to go through the initial offering process, but going to open directly for trading.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eKeith, can you kind of just explain some of the thinking behind why that is?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Marshall: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAbsolutely - and great point to drill down here. Each asset that's going to be available for trading already went through the initial offering process on Otis. So basically, that initial first piece, the initial offering, has already happened in the past dating back to 2019 for the earliest, and is now being brought over to Public from the Otis ecosystem. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo on day one, any shares that are available to purchase are basically owned by individuals who invested through the oldest platform. Since this will be trading, not initial offerings, prices won't be fixed and can honestly vary minute by minute. One other important thing to note here, we're actually in discussions to bring similar third party assets to the platform for trading, which would be pretty exciting to again, add to the diversity of offerings on the platform.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay, amazing. Since the trading process, I think it's a bit different than what you see with stocks and crypto, I think that experience will be slightly different for users. Let's really kind of drill down more into it.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo at a high level, can you kind of just explain how will members use the app to buy and sell shares in alts?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Marshall: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe overall experience is similar to exchange listed stocks and crypto especially if you've traded crypto on an exchange before. The big difference being members are buying directly from each other, which again affects liquidity. The experience itself will have some slight nuances, though mostly tailored to these being slightly different types of securities. So to start, you enter an order to buy or sell. You're going to put in the price you'd like to pay or receive, and the quantity you'd like to buy or sell. If that price is agreeable to someone who wants to put in a matching, buy or sell, the trade clears cash and shares change hands, and everyone is hopefully happy. If there's no match, like if your price is too high or too low, the order will stay on the order book, and basically not be cleared. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo an example is like, let's say I want to buy a share for 1 cent, no one's willing to sell for 1 cent, my order stays on the order book. This process is actually what happens with traditional stock market exchange listed securities too, you just don't notice it, because the volume of orders in that market is so much higher. And it's similar, though still, because just because you want to buy Tesla for $1 doesn't mean anyone else is willing to sell at that price. So the difference here is that with this limited liquidity, you may or may not be able to buy or sell the quantity you want at the specific price you want.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay, Keith so I'm going to throw a bit of an alternative scenario your way and you can tell me what would happen in this case. So what happens if, for instance, a bid price that's higher than any of the ask prices is higher than any of the ask prices on the book? What would happen in that scenario? How would it be made?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Marshall: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo it is a traditional limit order book, but we have what's called best price execution. So rephrasing, you put in the highest price you're willing to buy, or the lowest price you're willing to sell plus a quantity. That doesn't mean it actually executes at that price, though. So say, for example, that someone's willing to sell one share for $100 and ask.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you're actually willing to purchase for up to $125, and put in a bid for $125, you'll still get the best price, meaning the trade actually clears at that $100 that someone is willing to sell, not the $125 that you'd be willing to pay. Put differently, again, prices don't have to match exactly, they just have to cross. That's what limit order means. It's the max limit in which you're willing to buy in the min limit you're willing to sell.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay, nice. So so taking all of that and that nuance, how does that translate into some of the ways that a Public member can use the information that they're seeing on the order book, when thinking about an asset they want to invest in?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Marshall: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe ability to buy and sell depends on both price and quantity. So it really goes to your goals and specific timing needs. If you want to buy or sell immediately, you need to look at the order book and say, am I willing to transact at the price that's readily available? Because basically, you need to match an order that's already in the order book. And even then you might not get the quantity you want. So a concrete example, say you really want to buy one share of the Shattered Backboard game worn Jordan sneakers. There's an ask for one share on the order book for $10. That might not be the best price, for example, the last share might have sold for $7, but you could buy it immediately for $10, and you might do so if you wanted to buy 10 shares, you could still only get one share at that $10 price sale. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo the order book plays in here by giving you kind of a live view and how other people are willing to transact. And alongside that, transaction history helps you see where people are actually transacting. If instead, your goals are a little different, you don't need to buy or sell immediately and are more focused on price, then you can use the order book to gauge demand for the given price. So for example, let's say most people are selling at $10, you're only willing to sell for $100, so it’s probably fairly unlikely there's going to be a willing buyer, given that everyone else is willing to sell at $10. The same would be the case on the flip side, if for example everyone's selling at $10 and you're only willing to pay $1. There's just not going to be enough liquidity at the given price and quantity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay, great. No thanks, Keith, for explaining all of that. I think that's really helpful information. And for everyone in the audience,I know that we're throwing quite a lot of information your way. There will be an FAQ available on alts, which will kind of explain everything and reiterate everything that Keith has said and mentioned in this episode. We’ll also be doing a second Public life in a couple of weeks, which will be giving everyone more of an intro into the assets themselves, so that will be opening on Public for trading initially. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut I would like to talk a little bit about some of the behind the scenes regarding the actual assets themselves from acquisition to how they're handled. So Keith, maybe we can start here, which is, first off, how does Public even acquire these assets in the first place?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Marshall: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo it's easy to get super bogged down into securities and trading and all that stuff. This side is the fun part. And what's really exciting in our business, and it's really, because high quality alternative assets are just difficult for most people to access. And it's mostly because of price and also scarcity.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTaking wine as an example, some of the best wines, it might be $100,000, or more for a single case of wine. For great art, it can be over a million. That's things that normal people really just can't access at all, even if you can find one, you probably can't afford it. And one of the main functions of the alts team here at Public is this platform supply, which is run by my colleague Leah. So we work with a network of collectors, auction houses, galleries, and different providers in various categories to find these specific assets, and vet the quality. So we're also looking to work with partners that hold assets already or have deep expertise in a specific category, like wine or real estate being two good examples.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, and I think to your point, it's one of the really cool aspects about what we're doing, which is making these assets which could potentially be worthwhile investments for people. Of course, that's not investing advice, making them accessible to a wide variety of people. You kind of spoke about the acquisitions, how that's the fun part of what we do. What does Public look for when we're considering assets for potential acquisition?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Marshall: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWe generally look at a category by category level, and look for things with established collector bases, strong sales history, that typical stuff like art, wine trading cards, comic books, luxury handbags, video games, even sneakers. Basically, there's an existing market for them and data to back up sales in that market. So the key point being public sales data, because this is super helpful for us as we look to gauge pricing and these assets we're looking at. And we're usually evaluating for three particular things: cultural significance, scarcity, and price. And these are all generally important for return potential, returns, of course, number being guaranteed, but there's varying parts to them that affect price. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo a great example is the shattered backward sneakers that I mentioned, which were game worn by Michael Jordan. They actually embody all three of those really well, because the shoes represent a very iconic moment in sports history, when Jordan shattered the backboard from a dunk during an exhibition game in Italy. And there's even a piece of the glass embedded in the shoe still, which is just super cool. So there's your cultural significance. It's a key moment in sports history. This also happens to mean there's built in scarcity. It's a one and only asset because Jordan wore these shoes during the game. The downside to that and incredibly high scarcity is they can make price determination tougher. Scarce, your assets, of course, tend to command higher prices so it is a very key factor. This asset, though, again, benefited from a prior auction sale. So we actually had a market driven price on which we can base our acquisition, because we never want to overpay for an asset, because that'll affect investors returns if we eventually do sell a specific asset. So all three factors play into whether something is a fit for our platform as a whole. Again, by no means should this be considered a recommendation to invest in any of these or the Shattered Backboard.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNo, I think that's great context. And I think it's also helpful even just seeing it behind the scenes, how rigorous that process is of evaluating whether an asset would be a good acquisition. Let's go and talk about what happens post acquisition. So can you kind of just go into a bit more detail about how the physical assets are managed after they've been acquired?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Marshall: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCondition is absolutely critical for these assets. So we take asset management incredibly seriously. And we're not just throwing these things in a corner of the office, there's incredibly robust protocols for what we're doing with these. Physical assets are securely shipped to specialized storage facilities that know how to deal with these things. So for trading cards, that's PwCC in Oregon. For other assets, like art and sneakers, that's Uovo, which is a fine art storage facility, with a location on Long Island City that we use. And each has their own security protocols, temperature and humidity controls, trained staff members, it's basically the full package to make sure that these assets are kept as best they should. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur physical assets are also covered by insurance during transit and placed in storage facilities. So we're taking steps to make sure they're safeguarded in real life. And in terms of value. Intangible assets, like NFTs differ slightly. In part, there are no insurance products available yet for some of them. But we do use industry practices such as you know, using a multifactor Gnosis safe to hold NFTs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay, nice. And I think once you once even you keep talking about the process that we go through in the research that we do, to first acquire the assets, and then everything that happens around storing, and the logistics and the insurance of the assets, you start to see why investing in these sorts of things, has historically been quite inaccessible, which I think is why it's why it's so powerful and why it's so cool what we're going to be able to do here. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore I get to the final question, just a reminder for everyone in the audience, there will be an FAQ, once alts are launched, which kind of explains and reiterates everything that Keith has said. So no worries if you've missed it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOkay, so on the final point, I understand that every asset also comes with a document called the “offering circular.” Can you just explain to the audience? What is the point of offering circulars, and why might an investor want to read them?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith Marshall: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSure. So the offering circulars is an investor's best resource. And it's the foundation for diligence in one of these investments. The offering circle is actually part of the initial offering process, so it's the main thing that gets filed with the SEC. But the info is still relevant for those participating only in trading because it describes the legal entity, the asset itself, and even the management of the asset. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe offering circular is basically a very long document that details all sorts of information, you might need to know about the company, the asset, Public itself, how we deal with the asset, how we store the asset, what our insurance protocols are, and most importantly, providing a substantial list of risk factors that describe things that could affect your investment in an asset like this. So it's a really important document to review if you're considering investment, and we provide links in app to the offering circulars for particular assets. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne thing I'd like to call out those, these are point in time documents - they're made for the initial offering. So we do file periodic updates on the SEC EDGAR website, along with these up to date financial statements like semi annual unaudited financial statements, and audited annual financial statements. So there's additional information available online.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, so definitely encourage everyone to take a look at one of those. Thank you so much, Keith, for joining us on the show today, your first alts show. I’m sure there'll be a few more. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor now, for everyone in the audience. The big thing to remember is that alts will be coming very soon, later this month on Public, so keep an eye out there. We're really excited to be bringing these assets to everyone and allowing everyone to start investing in everything. Thank you, everyone for joining us today. Have a good one.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","eventType":"PUBLIC_LIVE","assetCategorization":["ALTS"],"sponsorDetailsDto":null,"audienceCohort":"ALL_MEMBERS","hosts":[{"publicId":"60d8add1-1fb3-4d33-9778-b7d8e682b55b","username":"keithmarshall","displayName":"Keith Marshall","profilePictureURL":"https://prod-api.154310543964.hellopublic.com/static/users/images/1yEN8T0kOqrTEUKTLaNoCDyIN4rrFXxu-thumbnail-300x300.jpg","verified":false,"isPrivate":false,"bio":null,"followedByMe":false,"following":false},{"publicId":"d0b2d87d-5846-4b13-800d-7b9e62c33559","username":"calumjohnson1","displayName":"Calum Johnson","profilePictureURL":"https://prod-api.154310543964.hellopublic.com/static/users/images/kUJQinOxEGImVVSsF17ud352BcYVJvTT-thumbnail-300x300.jpg","verified":true,"isPrivate":false,"bio":"Marketing Manager at Public|Host of the Public Live Alts Show\n|All opinions are my own, not investment advice","followedByMe":false,"following":false}],"stocks":[],"slug":"https://app.public.com/live/alternative-assets/introduction-to-alternative-investing","uniqueId":"QaZfJzTtbwOAmGB0FqSHomUEWD3znwGM","status":"PUBLISHED","linkedIds":["EnhFZQZ3CDGIjC17tdsF9seSeCzcFndz"],"cta":{"buttonText":"Sign up","title":"Introduction to Alternative Investing","subtitle":"Invest in stocks, ETFs, cryptos, alts, and more.

Welcome to Alts, the show on Public all about alternative investing and emerging trends happening at the intersection of culture and investing. I'm your host, Calum Johnson from the Alts team. Before we get into it, let's get the energy in the room up. Let's hit that like button. We've got a really exciting episode for you guys with some great guests. So let's get into that.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday we are joined by Dylan and Bradley from Altan insights, the leading platform for alternative asset investing, intelligence and analysis. Dylan and Bradley will be sharing some of the biggest findings from their latest research on the sports collectibles market covering both sports cards and memorabilia. Since we're going to be talking about so many current events and what's happening in these markets, at the moment through the report, and there's a lot to get through, we're going to skip the five and five and jump directly into it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo without further ado, let me hand it over to the guests. Dylan, Bradley, could you quickly reintroduce yourself to the audience? I know you've come on Public live a few times. Introduce yourself and Altan insights. Give us a bit of an overview of the new report that you've just released about sports collectibles in general.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eGreat. Thanks, Calum and thanks for having us back. My name is Dylan Dittrich, and I kind of lead the research effort at Altan Insights. And what Altan really focuses on is kind of empowering and arming the modern investor to explore alternative asset classes. Specifically, we look at collectible asset classes, things like fine art, wine, sports collectibles, classic cars. And so providing research analysis and data to kind of dig deeper into those asset classes, understand how they perform and understand the different kinds of forces that drive them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so as part of that effort on a quarterly basis, we put out a report on the state of the sports collectibles market, how sports cards are performing, how sports memorabilia is performing, you know, what are the different trends in different sports? How are collectors and investors approaching these categories? So I certainly would encourage everybody to visit the site and download the report if you're interested and have the time - but it was certainly an interesting second quarter to chronicle. Much like other assets that can be more speculative in nature, sports collectibles were challenged in some pockets, but had some really kind of interesting and even encouraging things happening in others. So looking forward to kind of diving into those with you guys today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd I'll just second Dylan. Thank you for having me on. I'm with Altan Insights as well. I do research alongside Dylan. I worked on the sports collectibles report that we put out recently in the first and second quarters as well as our art report and I’m also a qualified appraiser with the International Society of appraisers covering art, collectibles and memorabilia. So I've always had a big interest in the valuations of these assets, following them as actual investable vehicles and just tracking the data and the performance records everything that you can see in our reports on a quarterly basis, and you know, just putting out the research that we do looking at the sales and kind of going beyond just the numbers, so thank you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, great. Thank you both for the introduction. I want to get straight into the report. So like, what have we learned about the sports collectibles market in Q2? And I want to take kind of one of the big points that you made in that report, which was, are we seeing a healthy reset of the market away from speculation, or has a paradigm shift occurred that will change the way these markets perform going forward?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so I think just to zoom out a little bit, like some other categories of when, when the pandemic hit, kind of fueled by nostalgia fueled by stimulus checks, fueled by more time at home, sports collectibles really started to soar. So sports cards in particular, as people kind of, you know, revisited old treasures that might have been in the basement or the attic, and kind of revisited hobbies from their past. And it just brought a huge new audience into this space. And with that new demand came, you know, very rapid appreciation in these categories. And, as was the case, in other categories that saw similarly heightened demand over the last few years, the second quarter of 2022, was was challenging, as people became kind of skittish about the state of the economy, skittish about, you know, traditional financial markets, they were relatively eager and willing to sell these assets. And in many cases, that led to, you know, significant kind of declines in value across many different categories within the sports collectible space. And so I think a part of that is, is very likely a healthy reset of perhaps some things that had run a little bit too high, too fast.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut I think it's also important to add the caveat that, you know, it seems kind of indisputable that since before the last few years, the audience has definitely grown for the long term. And so, you know, we'd still expect to see there, you know, be more interested in this space than there was previously. But you know, when there's economic economic turmoil, when there's traditional financial market turmoil, it's not uncommon to see speculative assets like these sell off, even though that hasn't necessarily always been the case in sports collectibles. You know, historically, in other moments of financial crisis, economic crisis 2008, 2009, for example, you know, there are indices that suggest that sports cards didn't sell off that much. But, you know, we live in a very different kind of market today where people can basically sell cards that at a moment's notice, you know, friction is much lower than it has been in the past. And so when kind of investor and collector sentiment turns, you know, people can act on that, and so very easily nowadays and, and I think that played a role in sending some valuations lower in q2.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eBradley, did you want to jump in?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley: \u003c/strong\u003eI second Dylan on that. And also say that while we saw those pullbacks within the broader market, and I'm sure we'll touch on the upper end of the market, it continued to hold up well, which is something we haven't seen tested over the last few years, right. These are markets that have been tracked in some cases for decades now, and to see the broader market pull back rather significantly, and in some cases, well beyond even just a traditional stock market or other asset classes, but then to also simultaneously see the highest end of the card market your your blue chip type cards and memorabilia, seeing record prices, and in some cases, the auctions seeing heightened volume, more bidders, an increase in bids on high end cards definitely showed just a shift almost, when you look at a traditional market, that movement from maybe growth to value that you see sometimes in downturns. So it's certainly some things that we see across other markets are being replicated in sports collectibles as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, awesome. And just as a point for both of you, definitely feel free to just jump in whenever you want. We want to be as much of a conversation as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think you both made some great points. Dylan, I wanted to pick up on one thing you mentioned, which is the sports card market today, there's a lot less friction when it comes to access to liquidity. Could you go a bit deeper into that like, versus what we've seen historically, what are some of the factors that have caused there to be a lot less friction in the market, it's a lot easier for people to, like exit their position. Is that auctions? Is that the fractional markets? What are some of those factors that have caused that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, I think when you think about all of this new demand that's come into the space, you know, with that comes investment dollars and the pursuit of innovation, to make things, you know, easier on that new demand to make it easier for them to transact. And so I think a lot of the leading platforms in the space, whether you're talking about auction houses, whether you're talking about marketplaces, the technology that they're using has advanced considerably. The marketing around auctions has increased considerably, the frequency of auctions has increased considerably. And there's also a lot of, you know, competition to be the venue where people are buying and selling sports collectibles, and so that has the power to lower costs as well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so, whereas, you know, in decades prior, somebody might move to sell a card, and they might have to wait, you know, a month or two for the next auction, or they had to, you know, create their own eBay listing and kind of wait for that to be completed, it's really a lot easier today and it takes a lot less kind of manual legwork. And there are many platforms, you know, kind of designed to make buying and selling these things akin to buying and selling stocks. And we see that with fractional platforms as well. And so there's definitely an increased focus on liquidity, which is great, that means you can convert your asset to cash in a shorter amount of time and with greater ease. But on the flip side of that, that means that, you know, a market and valuations and price levels can react a whole lot faster when people start getting a bit nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, I think it's such an interesting point that like the reduction in friction, means that from a psychological point of view, investors in sports cards can now act a lot more similar to how, you know, investors in more traditional assets, like stocks can behave.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and I think, you know, to use an example from a more traditional asset class, you know, you know, the performance of asset classes, like private equity and private real estate, are always touted as being quite strong on a risk adjusted basis. But part of that is because the, you know, the valuations are kind of marked to market, aren’t updated with as greater frequency as public markets. And these, you know, private investment firms aren't buying and selling with as much frequency as actors and traditional public markets. So in a way that kind of smooths over those, those rough economic and financial patches, it's not to say that their performance isn't strong, but there's there is kind of an element of the way that it's measured, you know, kind of making things look a little bit stronger on paper sometimes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, that's a really interesting point. I want to get a bit deeper into the data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd Bradley, maybe we can check to you for this one. I know one of the things that you mentioned in the report, was that you use the PWCC indices to kind of understand the market and what's happening. Can you quickly just explain to our audience, first of all, why is the PWCC indices so important for that? And then also, what are some of the limitations of using those indexes to look at the market today?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, definitely. So PWCC they’re a marketplace and auction house and they have multiple indices, they have five ranging from the PWCC, 100 500, and then 2500. And their indices track a range of cards, but they are primarily vintage based. So you mentioned, like some of the shortfalls of those indices, one of them is that they do primarily track vintage cards, so cards dating really pre 1980s. And so PWCC, they really have the longest tenure as a performance tracking metric, they date back to the early…actually to 2008 is when the PWCC indices start. So you kind of get that tail and in the 2009 timeframe of the financial crisis. So you have one of the reasons why I believe that they're used so frequently is not only because they date back, but more importantly, because they date back to a very specific moment in financial markets history. And they, if you look at the indices, they do change in terms of their composition, but they primarily revolve around your blue chip Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays, Jackie Robinson, Babe Ruth cards, whether they're rookies or just pre-war, or close to post-war cards, and those cards while they've performed very well, it's not always the greatest representation of the overall market. As I had discussed previously about how the broader market struggled but the blue chip higher end market performed very well, we just saw that happen.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo if you're looking at, you know, the last six to nine months, you might see a lot of cards across the board. And a lot of cars, maybe people on here owned, have maybe dropped in value. But meanwhile, we're seeing some record sales for Honus Wagner or Mickey Mantle or Babe Ruth, or whoever that player might be in their rookie cards or in some of their early cards, that maybe is not the greatest representation of the overall market. So that's the one challenge, it is used just because we need some way of tracking an industry that has a composition of multiple cards across a span of time. But as with any industry, it might not be the best representation of the overall market and also of the sale frequency. So it's not necessarily looking at in a downturn market, is the volume still the same? Are people still selling their cards in that period of time? Are people still buying those cards in that period of time? Is the market still as active? There's a lot of metrics that maybe aren't incorporated in some of those indices, which do create the shortfalls, but are still important to include in any research and analysis.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eI think it's such an interesting distinction, definitely when I started to learn more about sports cards, the distinction between like the vintage older cards, and then the more modern sports card, and perhaps you can both touch on this. Why do vintage markets perform so differently than like, more modern sports cards? Is it purely just about scarcity and supply? Or are there other factors that we can look at?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so this is, this was definitely one of the more interesting kind of tidbits to come out of our Q2 analysis. If you looked at second quarter performance of vintage and prewar cards, they were effectively flat down very, very slightly 1 to 2% versus modern and ultra modern cards, which were down in the neighborhood of 15 to 20%. And I think part of that is, you know, modern and ultra modern tend to be a bit more speculative in nature, you have speculation on players that are currently active younger players, people who have more of their career left in some areas, particularly in the ultra modern space.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd when you look at vintage, there's a very long tenured collector base, the scarcity is naturally very low, just just by nature of the fact that these cards have been around for decades and decades. You know, over time, some have been lost, they've been damaged, so supply is very low. And I think, you know, many collectors aren't turning these cards over with as great a frequency - they're holding on to them. And that means less supplies available to the market, which of course can help keep, you know, prices kind of higher as demand grows, or even stays the same. And that's where you find a lot of quote unquote, blue chip cards that are very, very popular historically that are very well known, that are kind of like the top pieces of almost akin to fine art in this category. So a bit less speculation, less supply, and more longer tenured collectors and holders of these assets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and then just to add, there's also been so many market shifts across you know, when these cards were initially coming out, think about some of the cards maybe you've seen breaking records like a T 206 Honus Wagner like these were really advertisements. They weren't built for card collectors. They weren't being produced in mass for you know..they were being produced and then slid into a pack of gum or candy or cigarettes, or they were being stuck at tables at diners. They weren't being produced where then we saw that shift in the 70s, 80s, 90s, where then it rotated into what is known as the junk wax era where you had producers of cards, pumping out incredibly high quantities of cards. There's a ton out on the market, you don't really see a whole lot of 1990s players with high, high sales in their cards and today, the shift has really turned to grading where we’re seeing such an increase in cards being graded. People are sending them off to places like Beckett, PSA, SGC to be graded and a very high percentage of cards within populations are being graded. So it's just been a real overall shift in the market that has definitely aided I think vintage as standing out and standing alone from a period of time where people weren't collecting cards maybe for investment pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson:\u003c/strong\u003e Bradley can you kind of go –I think that's a really interesting point you brought up on the grading, right? Can you kind of go a bit deeper? What is the impact on the market overall of you know, you're getting more PSA 10s You're getting more BGS 9.5 or whatever, like, what is the impact on vintage versus modern?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, definitely. It’s an impact that I don't think is probably being discussed enough. We do cover it quite a bit. We have a partnership with a company called Gem Rate, who tracks the percentage and the number of cards graded by companies like I mentioned previously, PSA, Beckett,STC. And for example, just PSA alone, they're seeing record cards coming through and being graded in items altogether. You know, their Q2 numbers, and this past quarter were the highest they've ever had graded. I believe the past month was their highest month on record. So at this point, you know, they've had two months this year, believe it was March, and then now July that have been their two highest grading totals in company history, in terms of just number of items.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd that impacts everything because a lot of these prices, especially in modern cards are dictated by the grade. So for example, PSA grades on a numeric scale one to 10. With as well as an authentic grade if the card is maybe in too poor of quality, to receive a number. But a PSA 10, which would be like a gem mint card, the highest tier, will historically sell for higher than a PSA nine of that same card, right? There may be a flaw in the nine that deducts that one point. The problem is that people today are pulling cards out of packs and sending them immediately to PSA, the card has a higher chance than receiving a 10. And in turn, that overall population is skyrocketing, right? We're seeing some players like in the NBA, Zion Williamson, John Moran, where they have super high numbers of - I mean talking 10s of 1000s of PSA 10 graded cards for some of their base cards right now. Where for example, with the vintage, you have to almost get to the 60s before you start seeing a lot of these cards, receiving tents and that just comes down to people weren't pulling them and sending them out\u0026nbsp;immediately from packs. So it definitely is having an impact. And I think long term, we're going to see a swell of cards that were graded, that received 10s. It's going to be very difficult to really ever find appreciation and an increase in value when you have a card that has 20,000+ grades, and then maybe 10 to 15% of that population is a PSA 10.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd if you think about it, Calum, if you're an owner of a great advantage card, the threat of the population have that card growing now and really making your card a lot less valuable just by nature of the supply growing is a lot lower relative to modern because you know these cards have been in circulation they've been unwrapped from packs decades ago, you know, every now and then yes, some some new population will find its way to the to the grading companies. But you know, the likelihood of that happening at scale is much lower than it is for modern and ultra modern cars, and that's why the kind of the risk return formula, so to speak, for vintage is a lot different than it is for modern and ultra modern cards.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, I think that's super interesting. I'm going to ask one more question on the card point before we shift over to game one memorabilia and memorabilia overall, which I know is a very different picture than the card market.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think one thing that was interesting as I was going through the report is amongst all kind of the doom and gloom in the sports card market, there were some promising signs. The economist David RPA, modern hockey card record sale at Heritage last month, the upcoming heritage auction for the Mantle. Can you both just kind of comment on those two sales and what you think they might indicate about the market overall as we look forward?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich:\u003c/strong\u003e I mean the Mantle sale - so for context, one of the very highest graded 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle cards is up for auction at Heritage auction later this month, the special card because basically what happened was, these cards weren't wildly popular. When they were released back in 1952. They sat on shelves, and it was time for basically the 1953 print run to start being sold and tops needed the warehouse space. So they basically dumped boxes, and boxes and boxes of these cards into the ocean. And Mickey Mantle is kind of one of the preeminent, you know, baseball, cultural icons, certainly baseball card icons. And so probably one of the four very best examples of this card is being auctioned later this month. It's already over $7 million at auction, there's, I think, a pretty strong expectation that it's going to end up at $10 million plus.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe last time there was a sale of..so that's an SGC 9.5 Mickey Mantle. Back in early 2021, there was a sale of a PSA nine mantle for $5.2 million. And, you know, the stats are pretty clear that afterwards, not only did the broader and kind of lower quality Mantle market absolutely soar higher, but you could make the argument that, you know, it led to, you know, significant appreciation in the broader card market as well. It's a really big deal when a sale that big makes a very wide range of mainstream news headlines, because that creates new demand. It gets people excited about the space again, and it tends to have pretty wide ranging impacts. Now granted, it does take a sale of $5 million or $10 million to generate that excitement, which is exceedingly rare, but it does happen and it'll be really interesting to see, you know, what happens in the wake of that sale next month, or later this month rather.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd all along the Mantle card has always stood out from a baseball standpoint, similar to in hockey. We've had a seven figure sale of Wayne Gretzky, but we have also been tracking as you mentioned, the McDavid card. So modern hockey has similar to some of the other modern sports has lagged pretty significantly in terms of the overall market. So in the first quarter, golden oxygens sold a Sidney Crosby card. It was a gold precious metal gems and went for 100 in just under $165,000, which set a record for any modern hockey card. And then in this past quarter or the past quarter we've just had or past month, there was a 2015 Connor McDavid card, which is an autographed patch card. So it has a patch from a game worn jersey within it, and it's sold for $228,000. So that established a new modern hockey card price.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd actually, this is very timely, because just this week, there was one of the other so there are three cards in the population for the Connor McDavid that are graded PSA 10, and another one just sold this week for just over $200,000. So heading into the second quarter, we had never had a sale for a modern hockey card go for more than $200,000 and now we've had one, you know, essentially in the past 30 days now we've had two cards, same card, same grade, but it was definitely a validating sale to see one sell via eBay for over $200,000. So definitely some momentum within that market. But again, it's really a couple names: Connor McDavid, Sidney Crosby, Alexander Ovechkin. But beyond those three, hockey though, just continues to trail the field overall for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, very interesting. I'm conscious that we're nearly at time. Everyone can stay on if they're interested to hear more, because we're gonna go into the sports memorabilia market. And I think if Q1 was kind of, you know, there was a plunging in the sports card market. I think it was the exact reverse on the sports memorabilia side.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCould you, and I'll put this to both of you. Can you kind of just give us some context, data wise what we saw with sports memorabilia, and then also like, what is the significance like why did this happen?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so on kind of the second part of that question first. So when the sports card market was was booming, you'd see, and Bradley just alluded to one of them, you would see these cards that have little patches from either a game worn or player player worn jersey, selling for, you know, hundreds of 1000s of dollars, which in many cases is more than a full game used jersey would actually sell for. And so I think for the last few years, people both outside of the space, especially but also inside the space, have kind of taken a step back and said like, that doesn't make any sense. Like why is this little patch that's, you know, encased in cardboard selling for more than an entire game use jersey. And I think, you know, the idea that that shouldn't necessarily be the case has started to take hold, and the second quarter we saw, really for the entirety of 2022, but really in the second quarter we saw game worn jersey sales make headlines, there was a Diego Maradona, game worn jersey from the famous Hand of God World Cup match sold for over $9 million. Sotheby’s Golden Age auctions sold a set of Tiger Woods clubs from when he won the tiger slam for over $5 million.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so we just saw a huge volume of sales that were kind of headline sales that were over six figures. So to put it in context, in the second quarter of 2022. There were 42 sales at auctions of game used memorabilia that crossed $100,000. A year ago in the second quarter, there were just 13. So you're talking about more than triple, you know, increase. And I think a lot of that is, you know, card collectors coming into this space and realizing that there's, you know, an opportunity to own some incredible artifacts that, you know, maybe stand out from kind of the traditional to their traditional kind of cardboard pursuits.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, we put out actually a thread today on Twitter, Altan Insights, where we covered some of these record breaking sales and sports memorabilia. And one of the big highlights is, you know, the record books have really been reconstructed this year. There's three of the five largest public sales ever that have occurred. In terms of sports memorabilia, just this year alone. Dylan mentioned the Maradonna and then also the Tiger Woods. Also the Muhammad Ali championship belt that's sold. So we're just seeing the shift of people going after these really high end really impressive items that have historic context around them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo it's really exciting to see this shift in this movement of money that's going after you look at even at the Heritage auction coming up that we mentioned, there's the Mickey Mantle card, and that's going to be the big headline grabber. But very likely we'll see a new record set for a baseball bat. There's a 1918,1920 circa Babe Ruth game used in sign that that right now is priced just under a million dollars. I wouldn't be surprised if it by the end of the auction is a multi million dollar bat. It's a really impressive piece that is one of the earliest bats on the market that we've ever seen. I know there's been a lot of collectors out there looking for Babe Ruth's first bat that he used. So that had hit the market back in the early 2000s and went for over a million dollars. It hasn't came back yet. But this bat is probably about the second best thing that we've ever seen.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd the momentum is just continuing within the space. And also just announced yesterday, I believe Sotheby's is going to be selling a Michael Jordan jersey from the 1998 NBA Finals. And that jersey will likely establish not only a new record for any Michael Jordan, game use jersey, but actually any basketball jerseys. We would need to get up to about 4 million to do that. It has an estimate between 3 to 5 million, but with the momentum we're seeing in the prices for other athletes like Ali marathon Tiger Woods, probably seems fitting that Michael Jordan would fit in somewhere in that as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eNow that's pretty iconic. You know, one thing I wanted to follow up on when we talk about these really high sale prices, especially with sports memorabilia. I know one thing that comes into it is the photo matching element. Could you guys just speak briefly about - refresh the audience on what is photo matching, first of all? And then why has it become so important in the valuation of these assets?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, photo matching has become a critically important topic. I think it always, not always, but it has been important over the last few years, but its importance has only increased as you see these very high value auction items being sold, and therefore the stakes being raised. And essentially, for those that don't know, you know, if you talk about something like a Michael Jordan worn jersey, or you know, a Wayne Gretzky worn jersey from the Stanley Cup, you want to know, if you're paying millions of dollars for this item? How do I know that he wore it in this game.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so what photo matching is to kind of simplify it is basically comparing the game worn Jersey in question to very high resolution photos taken during the game in question, to match up very kind of, in most cases, minute details to confirm that this is indeed the jersey that was worn by that player in that game. And it can be things as small as you know, different holes in the mesh different, you know, little pieces of stitching, and how they appear on the jersey and, and matching those elements to the Jersey that's being sold.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd you know, I think when these very large prices are being paid, authentication is so very critical for the credibility of the market, for the credibility of those selling the item. And then for the buying collector to you know, be reassured that the item they've spent money on was who was really as built. And so photo matching is one way that that's accomplished. And you're kind of hard pressed to see nowadays, items sell for very high values without being photo matched to, you know, a certain moment. Generally not the case for more vintage items, for obvious reasons that the high resolution photography that you need to really make a conclusive photo match wasn't available until really, really more recently, but definitely important for any kind of more modern piece of game worn material.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd to follow up, we dove into some of the data behind that photo matching and just looking at so in Q2, out of the top 10 sales, eight of them were marketed as being photo matched. And so there's a few companies out there Resolution, My Gray, who photo match these items, and 18 of the top point five items sold memorabilia wise at auction in the second quarter, add some label or some nod to photo matching, and that compares to 60% of the top 10, the previous year, 12 out of the top 25. So a pretty big difference. It's been around as Dylan had mentioned, but at this point, especially as we start to see these modern assets and the memorabilia side, continue to develop in price, it's pretty much necessary outside of a certificate or a letter of authenticity from the league, or the player itself. You know, memorabilia has always been a little bit of a money market because a lot of these assets weren't supposed to ever make it to an auction house, right?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, the Tiger Woods clubs that Golden Age sold, there was a little dispute because Tiger Woods and his agent claimed to still have the clubs, because there's almost this idea that they're not supposed to ever leave the player and it's somebody's responsibility to grab that jersey after the game and keep it, or to secure the club so they never see an auction house. But it was the work of some experts in the space that looked at a bunch of attributes around the clubs between the grip to ball marks to photos, and then were able to provide an opinion a photo match that pretty clearly had an impact considering they sold for over $5 million and easily exceeded any previous golf clubs sold by about $5 million. So it's having an impact on these markets, no question about it. And I really think in the next few years, it's going to become...if it's anything that is photo-matchable so it's not vintage, but it's anything really 1970 on it's going to require some sort of photo matching being a given for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eIt's really interesting, and to be honest, it's pretty incredible that some of these assets they can even match it using photographs and all these things. Before we close out, I wanted to talk about the Muhammad Ali belt. Huge sale, there $6.18 million. I think the initial estimate was to be around like a million dollars.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan you talk about what was the level of photo matching that we saw there? What was some of the story behind that? Like, why did it exceed the estimate by such a large degree?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eSo this is actually one of those interesting and rare cases where there actually wasn't a photo match at hand. And really, what the kind of source of you know, credibility and authenticity here was the provenance so meaning what was kind of the line of ownership from, you know, when the belt was on Muhammad Ali to when it came to auction. So a little bit of background, I think it was last month, heritage sold the WBC Heavyweight Championship belt that Muhammad Ali earned for his win in the Rumble in the Jungle, and they sold it for just under $6.2 million.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis one came from the collection of Drew Bandini Brown, who was Ali's corner man. He kept a lot of artifacts, memorabilia from all of his career in a storage unit. Eventually, the contents of that storage unit were sold. But it's a case where you know you have pretty strong provenance. You know where that belt’s been, you feel fairly confident that this is a belt that was earned by Ali - it was worn by Ali.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd it really led to a bidding war between two bidders who were seemingly unwilling to lose. Turns out the winner was Colts owner Jim Irsay, who has basically been building a museum quality collection of kind of American cultural artifacts that he's actually taken on tour. So it's like, it's one of my favorite kind of investing rules for you know, really blue chip alternative collectibles is like, would Jim Irsay buy this because time and time again, he invariably shows up as a winner of a lot of these auctions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut yeah, one of those rare cases where, you know, photo matching wasn't playing a significant role in the authenticity here. But sometimes at an auction, all it takes is two highly motivated bidders to drive a value to, you know, levels that people previously thought were unheard of. Especially interesting in this case, because there is another WBC Heavyweight Championship belt that actually trades fractionally. And, you know, now that the question becomes, you know, what's that one worth? So definitely an interesting, very interesting piece of memorabilia. Very interesting story, and, you know, another just massive result.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eJust as a follow up, I actually spoke this week with a representative from Heritage who runs some of their consignment, and was talking to him at one point about that night when it's sold, and it was out of the blue for them. So we talked about where something like that comes from, he had actually gone to sleep, said he woke up at like 3am and stuff was like still going. And to see, you know, they, you know, some people that are going to be involved in the auction, for example, they set a million dollar estimate, they had word of mouth from some potential betters that those bidders weren't going to let it go for under a million. But that's all it takes is two bidders on some of these items.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd the same could go for this Mantle card coming up at the end of the month, or the Jordan jersey in September that I mentioned previously, like, it just comes down to if you have some people who are willing to put out that kind of money. And now we're at a point where that table and that tier has been set, where now it used to be a million dollars was a big hurdle for an auction house to clear. If they could clear that million dollar, you know, everyone was clapping and it was a really respectable auction. And that meant that they had a really strong line of bidders where it's almost 5 million at this point where, you know, it's like you're expected to have bidders lined up that are willing to push these items higher and higher the levels that we just haven't seen up until this year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, it's pretty incredible to be honest, when you look at some of the other asset markets for crypto, for stocks, and you see how bearish people are and kind of the the sentiment there that we still have some of these really high ticket sales and records being broken in some of the alternative asset markets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDylan and Bradley, It's been a pleasure to have you guys on the show again, you're always welcome.

Welcome to Alts, the show on Public all about alternative investing and emerging trends happening at the intersection of culture trend investing. I'm your host Calum Johnson from the Alts team. Today, we are joined by Gerard Starkey, sports memorabilia expert, and co-founder of SAAS. Over the last 20 years, Gerard has built one of the most valuable and complete Michael Jordan player exclusive game worn collections in the world, and has been featured in Highsnobiety and elsewhere, as one of the preeminent MJ collectors. Sports memorabilia is a really exciting alts category, and he'll be demystifying it for us today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore we get to that, though, we're going to cover some of the biggest headlines happening in the world of alts in a section I like to call five and five, five headlines in five minutes. Let's get started. So first of all, Nike sold a virtual NFT sneaker designed by artists to Kashi American army for $134,000. The sneaker was one of 20,000 in Nike;s first release with artifact in April. Collectors are hoping the shoes will become part of games like fortnight and Grand Theft Auto Six, while others are interested in physical versions of the shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eeBay is launching its first ever NFT collection. Thirteen limited edition NFTs that feature 3D animations of hockey legend Wayne Gretzky making one of his signature moves. They plan to drop additional NFT collections throughout the year in partnership with web3 platform OneOf.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe world's largest bottle of whiskey was sold for $1.4 million by auction house, Lyon and Turnbull on May 25. The bottle stands at an incredible 5’11 and was given a Guinness world record for being the world's largest bottle of whiskey in September 2021. It contains enough to fill about 444 standard bottles, or enough to make 5,287 whiskey sours, which is pretty crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNew York based real estate, investment and brokerage firm Acada listed a New York building as an NFT on OpenSea for 15,000 ETH, approximately $27 million. The NFT represents ownership of the building. However, the buyer still has to follow standard real estate procedure offline for the transaction to go through.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, a former OpenSea employee has been indicted in the first ever case of NFT insider trading. Thirty-one year old former Product Manager Nathaniel Chastain was responsible for selecting which NFTS would be displayed on OpenSea’s homepage. He would then use that information to buy those NFTs before they were featured, and then flip them for 2-5x profits after that. So that's our five and five for today. We're now going to switch over to speaking with our guest Gerard Starkey. Gerard, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to have you on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eThanks for having me on. It's a pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, awesome. I'm super excited for this one. So just to begin, can you give us a backstory? I think you have like the most valuable MJ game on collection out there. Can you kind of just give us an intro into how you got into collecting these items?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eI think first just to correct slightly, at one point in time, I was definitely the most valuable Michael Jordan collector, but in the recent in recent years, some very, very large investors have come in and bought up, you know, millions of millions of dollars of items in a very short span of time. So I'm definitely up there in the top two or three guys, but I'm possibly not the most valuable at this stage. But I was at one point.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, you're in the conversation for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I'm definitely up there. But I don't want to claim the crown without giving my peers and fellow collectors, you know, the same type of esteem all the way up at the top there. For me it started before value was even a concern because for me it started out of pure passion as a teenager. And as you said earlier on, I've been collecting for about 25+ years. And I didn't necessarily start in Michael Jordan stuff. Specifically like stuff he'd actually used. It actually started just in the kind of the regular kind of original Jordans that were available at the time and and gradually progressed through the various kind of categories of collecting whether it was like originals, hard to get rare samples, back to originals again, and then the original market.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOriginal releases of the Jordan shoes where it was very hot in late 90s, early 2000s, like it was, it just increased massively. And I actually was given a pair of game-worn Jordans from an ESPN athlete, I can go into that story at some point, but I was given them by an ESPN, so a cameraman, who was French. And when, as soon as I held that asset, the asset that I previously owned at the time, but that I previously collected didn't mean as much to me, because I had this asset that, you know, represented this athlete. And at that point, I took the opportunity to sell all my originals, which I sold very quickly. And I basically plugged it all into actual game news items. And now that was not as easy to find, but I'm quite resourceful. I speak seven or eight languages.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I basically went into the market on a global scale and just bought everything I could. And this went on for about 1015 years before the real boom happened, and I did it quite silently, because that was just my strategy, not quite being quite a competitive person. And being well, I was based in London, most of that time. So all of my peers were in Asia and the States. So for me to get stuff, I have to really hustle and bustle and just just grab as much as I could. And yeah, to this day, I don't sell my own collection, I just vault stuff and enjoy it and have it on display at my home and rotate it and collect things. I still obviously enjoy collecting. But you know, it's much harder now because the caliber of items I want to collect it's large sums of money. And I have to be quite selective, to be honest. Because I can't compete with all the bigger players in the current market. However, I obviously have a number of assets that these guys want. So the only way for me to really get into some of the really big, multimillion dollar items is to trade out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat's my collecting career in a nutshell and now I've built up so much expertise in the space that you know, I dibble and dabble in helping the Jordan Brand, do marketing campaigns. I am an adviser to big collectors around the world, helping them build up their collections. I do storytelling in displays around the world with various clients and partners. And I've got my own authentication company SAAS where, just like Public's doing, my main goal is to educate so that people can understand the assets, appreciate the assets, and get a really good sense of the value of the assets, because I think that's quite important. I think that is going to be the key element of this particular space, and actually any collecting space is going to focus on in the next sort of three to five years. It's all going to be about really getting specific, really getting clear valuations of stocks. At the moment, I think things are still bouncing around. But we'll get into that as we go through the question. So that's me and my collection, career from start to end and looking forward.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, sweet as you were saying that I was like, Gerard is living the dream, like the dream of any NBA fan, Michael Jordan fan. He is living it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI wanted to ask you because I think this is really interesting, and also just to give people in the audience a bit more context. Can you talk us through some of like those highlight pieces, those assets that are currently in your collection? Maybe like two or three of your favorite ones? And then also take us through like, how did you even get it? Maybe you can give us like a quick story of an interesting acquisition story.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, I think probably the asset that I own, the pair of shoes I own that people will most likely recognize, is that I own The Shot. So I own the Black Cement Jordan 4s that Michael Jordan wore when he hit the shot over Craig Ehlo of the Cavs. And that for me is definitely in terms of emotional value an asset that captures a really big turning point not just in Michael Jordan's career but in the whole basketball, NBA kind of history. It's, in my opinion, its top three, possibly top one or two moments ever. So that's definitely, in my opinion, the biggest asset that people will really appreciate, I think on a global scale without question.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI own obscure pieces like the Nike Alpha Force that Michael Jordan wore in the same kind of period, as he was wearing Jordan, threes and fours and he was trying to, you know, get comfortable in the shoes. There's some talk about him, it being a transition point, as am I going to stick with Jordan, they're trying different midsole shoes models, and he actually started wearing Nike Alpha force, which isn't the Jordan shoe. But he wore them two or three times, and I have the pair that he played in against the Milwaukee Bucks. So that's a cool, very unique piece, not as big a celebrity as The Shot. But definitely for me, it's a piece that I appreciate a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then you're seeing other other shoes that I would love to have in my collection that have eluded me. I mean, the obvious one, for me is the last shot, which is Michael Jordan's final pair of shoes, which, I mean, I've literally searched for, I mean, I'm a resourceful man. And I've searched for it far and wide. And I mean, there's two pairs out there. And one of them potentially, is that model. But there's also a possibility that Michael Jordan has kept that one himself, which would make sense to me. But it's just not a pair that I've ever been able to acquire. But that would be monumental. And I mean, the closest pair I've seen to that very last pair is actually up at Christie's actually, it's an auction I've held here, the shameless plug, but there is an amazing, low 13 game-worn Michael Jordan sample that's actually on the market as we speak. And that's pretty much as close as I think any of us will get to that last shot ever. And that's, that's an amazing piece.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eWhen you even think to yourself,\u0026nbsp;“I would love to own the last shot piece” or “ the last shot sneaker,” how does that process of even trying to track it down start? Is it all just personal connections? What's that research process?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's, I mean, my process is I mean, everybody knows I'm an actuary by profession. So my mind is quite analytical, I love a good spreadsheet. I love a good list. So over the years, I've basically built databases of you know, where these assets are, whether it's jerseys, shoes, bats, helmets, you know, not necessarily specific to Michael Jordan, but where big assets are, who owns them, you know, their numbers, their emails, some photos of those assets, the tagging just so I can keep myself fully educated as to you know, the authenticity and what I should be looking for.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI do actually have big personal databases that you know, are super valuable to me and help me try to track these things down. And once you get into the circle you know, you do meet insiders, insiders to these athletes, these these these gods so to say, of the world and you can navigate through, there is a there's a way to navigate through that community and figure out how to get out get out assets once you do a deal. Whenever I do deals in the past, it was never you were never buying one item. It wasn't efficient, you were potentially having to get on a plane and travel to Hong Kong or New York and as I said I was based in London in Europe most of the time. So if I was going in, I was going for the kill and I was going to buy as much as I could, you know? And when you get known to be a reliable person who does deals who buys stuff off the medics, the teammates, the ball boys, you know, use that they pass your lap around respectfully and they and you can you know pay the right money for the assets. And at the time it was much simpler like I said they were trying to get rid of assets anonymously without you going to the market. You know, there wasn't really a deep liquid market for them at that point. They also didn't want to be known to be selling the asset that Michael Jordan gave them, so it was much easier. But that's how I go about it and I apply the same technique. Circle still exists, you know, there are other layers, there are more auction houses, there are more dealers, there are more middlemen, but it's just navigating the space. Like any space just like buying a house or a property, it's very similar actually.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, awesome. I want to zoom out a little bit. I know, there's probably a lot of people in the audience who are interested in potentially investing in sports memorabilia, and just learning more about the market in general, could you kind of just quickly define for us, what exactly is the sports memorabilia market, and then what makes this category special?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, sports memorabilia market as an asset, if I was thinking about in a real simple kind of definition, any asset that captures an athlete, either his image or a moment, or an event in sports history. And this can be purely a photo on a card, or an actual item used at that point in time or something with a signature from that era. It's a very broad category, so it captures the essence of an athlete.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s an interesting category because, I mean, for me, first, take one quick step back to make it clear what the following statement means, to me, it's like an art. These are moments that people have created at the very peak of their career. And if anybody on the call has ever, you know, going down that route of being an athlete or doing a sport, you know, it is extremely difficult to work your way up that ladder to become the top person, just like any artists would have had to work, you know, hundreds of 1000s of hours, you know, to be known as the, you know, the Michelangelo or the Picassos of the world, you know, these athletes have created these moments by being that great. So for me, they aren't just rubber and canvas and suede and leather, and you know, and wood and whatever, whatever materials they use in the equipment. They're actual moments in time that represent something very deep, very hard to achieve, and hence, they are pieces of art, which you which become talking points become storytelling points. And that's how I treat it. So to me, it's art. It's the emotional value. It's the moment, it's a historical moment in time that they capture that they represent, that gives them value.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I think to your point, the emotional value is so strong, so strong, right? Like we remember those moments that MJ last game shot and different moments. One thing I'm interested in from the investor perspective, is what are some of the factors, the value drivers, of a certain piece of sports memorabilia? I know you mentioned obviously, the moment, like what it's associated with, the athlete. Is there anything else? Can you kind of just elaborate on what some of those important factors are?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eI mean, those are extremely important facts that you raised. But I think rarity is key, like with any asset. And now the space is becoming much more liquid, and much more, much more educated, people really understand what rarity actually actually means. Now, for me, rarity is literally a handful, you know, and I know there are assets out there. I mean, there is an intersection between demand, and, and supply. And, you know, the perfect example for me is like the card market, the sports card market, there could be 200,000 people who want this one card, and there's only 700 of them, and that seems like a very high demand ratio. And I agree, but actually, ultimate or absolute rarity, where you can have something that like two or three or no other person has, that for me is the ultimate factor. And as we get more educated, we need to know how to filter down to what that rarity actually means. So, in cards, there's, you know, there are populations, there are I mean, you have to think of what is important in the card, what is the emotional value in a card in the card mark is my interpretation. So all the basic stuff about the quality of the card, the centering of the card, you know, the edges of the card, how perfect that card is preserved, those are all very easy parameters to understand. The hard bit is actually delving down to actual rarity and the authenticity and the you know, and the meaning meaningfulness of that card.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I think with cards, the excitement usually comes from, say, pulling a card. So being able to calculate and understand the probability of you actually pulling that card that is going to be a big factor in rarity. Which athlete it was related to, that's going to have a big big driver of value and rarity, you know, within each of those athletes, each of those athletes have one or two cards that are the cards to have actually, they probably will have one card is the card. And if it is\u0026nbsp;the card that is in your basic kind of starting point, this is the card I want for Gretzky or for Mantle or for MJ. And then you have to take that particular card and then filter that particular example down into the best version of that example.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith game used stuff, it's slightly more complex because once it's far more complex, because it's there's you know, authenticating a card is quite simple, because they are just pieces of paper that capture that nostalgia, authenticating and valuing game used jerseys and shoes is there a lot more intricate details to look at tags and where and you go down this angle of the photo matching, and we'll talk about a bit more about photo matching later on. But after photo matching and understanding signatures, it then gets into this kind of moment, space. And up to that photo matching kind of factor that you're considering, the prices on these things will be kept because it's you know, it's just photo matched. And it could be, you know, just a regular season game, but it's photo match, you know, he wore it. So it's great, it's a great asset, but the price will be capped. The moment it's photo matched, but also the moment that it's photo matched to a huge or significant or turning point, then the price will just shoot up. And that's because it's rarity, meaningfulness, emotional value, and, and that's what these assets, you know, that's why those assets then sort of transition from a sports card or sports item into a piece of art and a piece of history. And I think people are getting far more educated. I mean, there are a lot of sports thinkers, kind of like myself and there's lots of people in the market who\u0026nbsp;try to go out there and kind of give these parameters to people and give that kind of food for thought. So they can think about the value themselves. And it is complicated, but I do really feel that the market is getting very sophisticated. And buyers we're getting very sophisticated and very demanding. And that's right, I think, and I actually support that a lot because it gives us base credibility and value.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eYou know, one thing I think that's so interesting, as I was listening to you speak is that, and I think this is a great point also for our audience. As you know, they continue to learn more about alts. And I'm even on my own journey of learning more about alts. And I think every kind of alts category has its own nuances, you know, when it comes to evaluating an asset. So for instance, you gave the example of sports cards where like the grading and the condition of the card is like a huge determinant. There's different determinants when you look at things like the art market or comic book market. And then obviously, sports memorabilia. Could you just elaborate a bit more? You spoke about photo matching, can we start at the beginning? Like what is even photo matching? Can you kind of just explain that whole process, like what does it even mean?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eSo photo matching - this will apply to game used stuff firstly, so you photo match game used items. And what that effectively means is that using images and video for when the asset was actually used. You're effectively able to superimpose the asset you have in your hand on top of the image, and every single crease, loose thread game used blemish, production blemish lines up so that it is absolutely conclusive that the asset you have in your head is the exact asset used by Maradonna or by you know, MJ or by David Beckham. And there is zero doubt there. I mean, it's just conclusively matched and attributed to that particular moment. And then if that moment is a big moment, then that's the next stage of kind of research and value.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Actually, to be honest, and in my opinion, once you've got the photo matched assets, you get so far up the chain. It's the moment that really adds value. You know, and I think, and the uniqueness of that moment moment and, you know, factors that you that the asset has that relate to that moment, you know, for example, I mean, a perfect example of a photo matched asset is something that Public actually have within their portfolio is the Shattered Backboard, Air Jordan 1, which is I mean, I'm obviously biased, because, you know, I was I was involved in that particular transaction some years ago. But that asset has photos of Michael Jordan, taking off his shoes, and giving them to the other athlete. Now, that's just unheard of. And that particular nuance parameter is super important because it not only photo matches the asset to something that MJ would have worn in a big moment, but it also photo matches the backstory and the provenance. So there's, you've conclusively photo matched but also conclusively fact checked, and you have photographic evidence of the backstory and how it actually got from Michael Jordan's feet, to the open market.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd the fact that Michael Jordan was the person handing the asset over is so significant, because usually, it would go into the admin team or his charity team, or, you know, his, you know, there would be a process because he was such a huge, huge, huge athlete, and he was huge from from day one. I mean, people knew he was a big deal from day one. So to have an asset that comes direct from him, insane. And for me, personally, I mean, if I would have value, it's way up there. It's way up there. I mean, Maradonna’s hand of God, and you know, Kobe's rookie jerseys have absolutely nothing on that particular shoe. But it requires a level of understanding and appreciation of what it actually is, you know?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's so interesting. I'm kind of interested to talk and like, get your opinion on what's happening in the market currently. I know, if we look at the top of the market, we saw in 2021, there was the sale of the 1984, Michael Jordan Airships, which kind of set a record at Sotheby's for over $1.4 million. What have we seen happen from that point? I know you alluded to some other things like sports memorabilia sales, just then the hand of God and different things. What are we kind of seeing in the market right now?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah so what is happening here is that the buyers and investors in these particular assets are extremely educated and they know exactly what they need that asset to have for it to be effectively a one of one, or a really big momentous moment. So the hand of God whatever the 9.3 million for that jersey, it makes absolute sense because it doesn't matter what what you do in life or what your interest in life, you know Diego Maradonna is and we know about that moment, and it's not particularly you know, a positive you know, it is a moment that that has a lot of controversy attached to it. And that just makes it a great asset, which is why that value makes sense. And it shows you the capability of some of these assets. You know, the Kobe Bryant rookie jersey is the one that sold for 3.6 and one that sold for 2.6, 2.7 photo matched rookie moment, rookie Jersey, obviously the passing of Kobe has helped those jerseys as well, rest in peace. But it just shows you that people really know what they want, it has to have every single parameter. If you had a photo of I mean, the Hodges who got the jersey from Maradonna is obviously proof a very good provenance, but there's no photo of Diego Maradonna giving the jersey to him, but it's obviously that the exact jersey because it's photo matched, and it was a very easy photo match and a great photo match. But it was such a unique moment. It was easy, but had Diego Maradonna signed that jersey or if there was an image of him, not being able to really speak English and Hodges saying hey, pointing Give me your jersey if that was documented it would be even more valuable. Similar to the Kobe jerseys, if there were other attributes that made it more unique, and that made the story more clear, the value just goes up, you know.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think what's going on the market is people are really buying meaningful stuff. I mean, I can speak more. I think my knowledge is definitely more expert on the memorabilia side. And as a game used memorabilia side, and I think that's what's happening there. And in my view on the card market, is that people are getting more educated on what actual rarity is. And, you know, I think, game used, and cards, there's definitely a vintage, historic and kind of modern market. As always, with cards, I do just think, by default, the vintage market will always be more valuable. But obviously, as time surpasses, you know, the new market becomes vintage, and it will gradually grow. But there are giants in the sports world, and they've been the same giants for many, many years, even with, you know, Kobe Bryant is a good example. And I think, as I said, that's why I said his passing has added value to those particular jerseys.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the Michael Jordan, rookie jersey, you know, if there was a photo match one it would be significantly more valuable than that. And I think a lot of the collectors in the sports space would agree to that. I know Michael Jordan is still alive, but he's not going to create any more of those moments. I mean, I've seen, I've recently seen an amazing asset, which I can't wait until it comes to the market, but I've seen his playoff, his first playoff rookie shoes. And it's\u0026nbsp;a really great photo match. And if, you know, if a Kobe Jersey sells for $3.6 million, I can see when a shoe like that comes to market or just explode that particular value, because it's such an iconic shoe. And it's his very first playoff and it was used in like two or three of the game. So yeah, I think people want the big pieces, the big investment, the big pieces, this is helping the medium and lower side of the market. But I do think that side of the market will stabilize a bit more, and the value will be very clear to everybody. But yeah, so I think what's going on, I think education is going to be key in terms of estimating the values.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, awesome. Okay, cool. I'm going to ask you one more quick question, because I know that we're running over. And I think I think it's such a great point that you make about education. And it's great to hear that, like, as the market is maturing that people, you know, they're getting more educated, they're getting more knowledgeable about these assets. And it's such a great time for the public, for our audience to then kind of come into these categories as well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy final question for you was, you spoke about Maradonna, Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan. These are obviously like Pantheon all time, great athletes, right? When you look at the current kind of crop of athletes who are playing now, are there any that you look at and you think, once they're kind of game used, game worn memorabilia kind of gets out there in the future, it could rival in terms of the sale price? It could kind of rival what we've seen with like, the MJ assets or the Kobe assets or the marathoner assets. Are there any kind of athletes that you look at that will do that?,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah I definitely think they have potential to get up there. This is the will in the basketball world. The Lukas and the Steph Currys, they will get up there. The one thing I will say for the modern athletes, basketball and other sports, is that their game-issued items are much more abundant. So they will be just a much larger supply that also applies to cards as well as a huge supply of modern cards. I do think they can get up there but they literally have to check every single box it would have to be highest scoring game, best playoff run you know you won't really have many multi game worn stuff because of the abundance of the jerseys and stuff for example, but yeah there are definitely are players that will get up there in basketball and football I'm trying to think. Well obviously the Nemars and Mbappes of the world will get up there because there's a direct link there to the Messies and the Ronaldos and the Van Bastens of the world.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut I think more of what would be the thing to look out for is the gods of the other sports where less focus is currently on at the moment. Those are the ones that will come up I think. I mean, I do honestly think basketball will always be Michael Jordan and then the Kobes and LeBrons and the other greats. Boxing will always be, you know, Mike Tyson. You know, the F1 Racing market will always be Schumacher. You know, Lewis Hamilton and Verstappen will be up there, you know, but everybody's going to want to go back to Schumacher. But I think with education and people understanding all the parameters that they're interested in and getting that real one of one meaningful moment, those will be the athletes we need to look out for that will just jump up there. So not necessarily specifically.. well, obviously, they have to be very good athletes in whatever sport they play, but it will be that one of one, this really unique story that makes them valuable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eSuper, super insightful.

I'm your host Kori Hale and of course, I'm always happy to be with you all, especially this afternoon. We're going to be breaking down what's going on in the regulatory environment as it relates to decentralized finance, better known as DeFi. We're going to be discussing crypto regulation, the recent actions taken by the US Treasury, along with the Securities Exchange Commission, and I am very thrilled to bring in our guest, Ari Redbord who is the Head of Legal and Government Affairs at TRM Labs to discuss crypto regulation. And of course, the road ahead in 2023. Ari, welcome to Public Live.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003eHey, Kori, thanks so much for having me and really excited to join Public Live today.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, we're happy to have you and to have this discussion. We have a lot of crypto enthusiasts within our community and I'd love to start out by talking specifically about the US Treasury Department. They recently initiated a risk assessment related to illicit financial activities within the sphere of this DeFi space, in your opinion, are what are the primary vulnerabilities exploited by illicit actors in the DeFi sector?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, no, it's a really important question. And to kind of set the conversation a little bit, this risk assessment was actually ordered by the White House framework on digital assets, which came out about a year ago. So while it sort of created somewhat of a regulatory framework, it definitely tasked a number of agencies and one of the tasks was for the US Treasury Department to do a risk assessment on D fi. And really, really important to note that this is just that it's a risk assessment with a focus on sort of what are the risks in the ecosystem/ It is not guidance, and it is certainly not regulation. And throughout the document, really Treasury talks about the need to engage with the private sector, with other agencies, and really have a conversation about ultimately, sort of what guidance or regulation should look like.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of that said, it focuses on the areas that you see also in this sort of centralized crypto space, whether it's ransomware. Hacks are a huge vulnerability for the DeFi ecosystem. In 2022, According to us at TRM, we saw about 3.7 billion in hacks, and about 80, or more percent of those hacks were against the DeFi ecosystem, bridges, protocols, Dex is and that's what it's a real concern. So there's a lot in this thing, but really, really important to understand, like, why does it talk about risk? Well, you know, that's exactly what it was intended to do is provide a risk assessment of the space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, a risk assessment, I think, many people would probably agree that's definitely needed, given the nature of DeFi. And especially what's happened in the past six to nine months in the broader crypto sector. But I'd love to dig into it a little bit more, because there are illicit actors, right? There are people that are, you know, in this space that are not necessarily trying to do good things. And that's what I'd love for you to explain to our audience. All right, how do these criminals actually use DeFi services? To do things like launder ill? ill gotten gains?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, no, it's really important. And whenever I talk about DeFi, I'm currently the vice chair of the CFTC Technology Advisory Committee as well. And as I said at our last meeting, look, if you're going to talk about DeFi regulation, you really have to start with the promise of this technology, right? This idea of sort of on-chain financial services, where we can have peer to peer transactions, you know, at the speed of the Internet. I think the technology is really, really extraordinary. But anytime you can move funds across border at the speed of the Internet, there are going to be vulnerabilities and illicit actors are going to try to take advantage of it and I think the challenge is for regulators, and Treasury really lays this out, is how do we sort of provide regulatory guardrails to make this ecosystem safe, but at the same time sort of not stifle innovation? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the really, really big takeaways, I mean, I think, for me, the most interesting of this risk assessment, is what it says is sort of about regulation. And again, you know, this is not guidance, this is not regulation, but Treasury says, look, if you are engaging in financial services, whatever your level of centralization is, right? DeFi, CiFi, or traditional finance, you have regulatory obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act, which is the US anti money laundering law. And I think that's probably going to be the most controversial piece of all of this, because there are a lot of sort of, you know, folks in the DeFi space who say, look, this is truly decentralized, disinter-mediated software that doesn't have teams of compliance professionals, it's sort of what we've seen in the traditional space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I think the regulatory piece is going to be a very big part of this. And to your question, I think what Treasury sees at least is, look, we have to ensure that there aren't gaps in regulation, and one of the gaps they see today is sort of non compliance in the DeFi space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eI mean, there definitely seems to be a lot of noncompliance. I want to pick up on something you said in terms of the Treasury, to look at how to not slow down innovation, but also, you know, providing, perhaps some type of risk parameters specifically, because we've seen this in other versions of tech, right, in different sectors where regulation has been at a much slower pace, right, than the actual technology and the innovation that's occurring. Is there something in what the Treasury is kind of proposing or what they're looking at that is specifically not going to slow down innovation? Are they always going to be two steps behind where DeFi is going? It?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri RedBord:\u003c/strong\u003eLook, I mean, government has always had this challenge. And I don't think we've ever seen anything move as fast in our lifetime, as we've seen the sort of crypto web three blockchain space. So it's always sort of this catch up game. Look, I think that you know, people are definitely appraising last week, the European Union, the European Parliament, passed Mica, the marketing crypto assets, legislation, really the first global sort of framework for digital assets, the sort of clear regulatory framework, and there's been a lot of praise around that. But when people sort of forget is that's about three years coming. That, you know, mica can't stem really from Facebook's sort of launch of the failed stable coin project Libra. So that's really three years ago, when European Parliament started thinking about Mica.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo the reality is that yes, you know, governments and regulators are always going to be sort of far behind the technology. But at the same time, I think what we're seeing in this risk assessment is an acknowledgement by Treasury and the US government that it's so important to bring the private sector into these conversations, because what we do well in the private sector is innovate. And so far, I think we've seen some of those conversations already take place, which I think is a really good sign. In other words, I don't know that we're going to see enforcement actions, I shouldn't say, I don't think we're going to see enforcement actions from Treasury, again, sort of DeFi for not having compliance controls in place over the next year. So I think what we're gonna see is conversation,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eif we start to see those conversations. are those conversations spearheaded by the DeFi, by industry, by that sector, right? So that, by the time, you know, the government, so to speak, decides to catch up and actually put some regulation in place. They're basically doing their own internal audits, as you mentioned, compliance sort of thing. And they're already kind of lining up the sector to say, hey, these are the standards and rules that we're setting across the board. You know, while the government back on Capitol Hill just tries to figure out what they think it is we should do?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003eYou know, it's an excellent question, this sort of self regulation question that permeates the space. And I think, look, if you think about the native qualities of public blockchains, right, they're transparent. They're immutable. So in other words, they allow for tracing and tracking the flow of funds in ways you really never could in traditional finance. And that also allows us in many respects, to kind of regulate ourselves right?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt TRM and a bunch of different industry players Circle and Binance and of others launched something called Chainabuse, which is essentially crowdsourcing, I think of it as the ways for crypto scams and frauds. It's a way this community can crowdsource to ensure that other people aren't taken by fraud and financial crime and you can report to law enforcement. So I say all of that to say like, I think that there are ways we can self-police the space in ways that were absolutely impossible in traditional finance, where we rely on intermediaries. So I think definitely, we are already seeing a world where not just DeFi but centralized exchanges are sort of coming together to sort of propose regulation and support regulation. But again, it's so important that this regulation doesn't go beyond what is intended to do and sort of stifle innovation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eWhen you talk about the companies and the things that people can do in this space, to perhaps self regulate, I guess it makes me think, Ari, what is what is after that, though, right? Because even if, regardless of if the government does it, or it's going to be self regulated, what happens to the illicit actors in the space? Are there sanctions? Are there obligations? If it's not going to be the government and it's going to be self regulated, who is the enforcer?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, no, it'll be the government, don't get me wrong, I think there's an aspect of self regulation that can actually absolutely occur, but I think it's gonna be a combination to be sure. And I will say this, look, you know, the nature of cryptocurrency, right? Cross border value transfer, this speed of the Internet is always going to be attractive to illicit actors. But when we see, you know, we see about the same amount of illicit activity in crypto as we do in the traditional financial system, which is a very, very small amount at the end of the day, almost infinitely small. So you're always going to have bad actors, right? If you don't have illicit actors in a financial system, it means the financial system is not robust, right? Bad guys are always going to want to engage, where sort of funds are flowing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of that said, sort of the nature of crypto and the ability for regulators to have a view of their regulated ecosystem, in real time for law enforcement to be able to track and trace the flow of funds on public blockchains. This all means that crypto could be a lot safer, ultimately, than Fiat, which relies on sort of, you know, siloed, intermediaries who report to the government suspicious activity reports and this sort of thing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I think the promise of the technology is, in part, the ability for regulators and law enforcement to use it and essentially, that's what we do at TRM. We provide software that enables that type of investigation and regulation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;I mean, that's good to know that your company is obviously out there already in the marketplace providing solutions to some of these issues. I'd love to shift our attention, though, for a second really quickly towards the SEC specifically, because they did send Coinbase a WELLS notice in regards to the firm listing unregistered securities on exchange, and some time, as we know has passed since Coinbase actually received the notice are what specific violations of security laws has the SEC accused Coinbase of? It kind of seems like they sent a letter and like not much has happened.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, no, look, there's this interesting..Certainly I'll first answer the question that is sort of, you know, the SEC is essentially saying look, Coinbase is listing unregistered securities, because certain cryptocurrencies are in SEC’s view, sort of most cryptocurrencies today are securities. And that's essentially the genesis of this letter. But that said, this is the issue that is permeating the entire space in the United States today. And it's really a definitional question, you know, are certain cryptocurrency securities? Are their commodities? Or are they something else? And every issue, whether it's sort of the CFTC, recent action involving finance, you know, talks about Ethereum as a commodity, but the SEC has talked about Ethereum as a security, or sees the asset rather as a security, and we see this letter to Coinbase. You know, there are cases involving, you know, sports celebrities and endorsers of FTX where one of the arguments in the case is that they were promoting unregistered securities. So ultimately, that question will be answered in that case, maybe from state to state courts.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I say all of this to say that the biggest issue today in our space is, you know, are things commodities? Are things securities? And ultimately, you know, we're going to continue to see see enforcement actions and regulatory action, until Congress ultimately provides legal clarity and actually says, hey, look, Bitcoin is a commodity, and these other assets are you know, securities, or maybe even something else. And I think my view is that, look, you know, this technology is so new and so extraordinary, that maybe this can be something else. But I think the real issue is we need that type of legal clarity and probably needed from Congress. And until we get that, we're going to continue to see sort of disagreement amongst regulators and continued sort of enforcement actions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, it definitely seems like the story continues to unfold in this space, because Coinbase as many of us know, here, they did take legal action against the SEC. And to be honest, that's not something you typically see companies do is take action against one of these government institutions, but this just happened on Monday related to the lack of clarity on securities regulations presented to the firm. Can you just explain for us? I'd love for you to break this down? What is Coinbase asking the court to do in its latest action against the SEC? And also did Coinbase do this, decide to take legal action against the SEC and for lack of a better term retaliation?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, look, I think, you know, you know, obviously, this latest action by Coinbase is, you know, is sort of the latest example, but really what we've been seeing for the last, you know, several months or even more, really a year, are businesses looking for clarity from somebody, whether it's the courts, whether it's guidance from regulators, which is really in this case, sort of what Coinbase is asking the court to\u0026nbsp;make sure to get the regulator to provide, but it's like, look, you know, there's enforcement actions, you know, against us for listing unregulated securities in the words of Coinbase. But, you know, no one's ever told us, you know, what’s a security and what's a commodity here, they've only sort of proposed that, you know, we have obligations under a, you know, 60, or 70 year old Supreme Court case called US versus Howey where there's a conversation of whether or not orange groves and enterprise around orange groves are securities, are investment contracts. So I think what it is, is Coinbase and really, it's not just Coinbase it’s across the entire industry, is looking for clarity, you know, before you bring an enforcement actions, says Coinbase, or other entities, you know, we need an explanation, we need guidance from you as to what is a security and what is not a security?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and whether or not they get that guidance before all of this back and forth, you know, legal dispute that's now, you know, taking plays really comes to a head, I guess, only time will tell because, as you mentioned earlier, things are happening so quickly in this space quicker than we've seen, and other tech enabled spaces and there, there's a lot of moving parts right, Ari to work out here? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003eThere are so many and at this point, you know, we have the executive branch I mentioned, you know, our conversation today started with Treasury, right, and you have the SEC, and you have the CFTC. And you have the Fed, all involved in this. We have the legislative branch, we had a hearing last week on stable coins. And there's a proposed stable coin bill out there, which we're told is not going to necessarily, you know, move without some revisions. We have a number of other bills that have been proposed in Congress, but really no activity there. We have. And then we have the courts to your sort of last point, right.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo we have all these different branches of government, you know, trying to sort of parse out a lot of these questions. But ultimately, it will come down to Congress to provide that sort of legislative clarity. And I'm not I'm not entirely sure that will be anytime soon. So we're likely to continue to see some of this sort of regulatory action from these agencies.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, I'm sure that your company will, of course, be keeping a close eye on all the movements in this space, and we at Public will be definitely updating our community as things progress. Alright, I just want to thank you so much for joining Public live this afternoon, everyone. Once again, this is Ari Redbord - he's the head of legal and Government Affairs at TRM Labs.

I'm your host Annika Lewis. Today we're joined by Pooja Rajan, founder of Etherworld and Ethereum community builder who will help us break down the game changing Ethereum upgrade that just happened, which has sparked a rally for the world's second largest cryptocurrency. Pooja, thank you so much for being here.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThank you. I'm so excited to be back here.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, very big week. Lots of news to discuss. So plenty to cover today.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eFirst off, can you tell us a little bit about what just happened? So what was the Shapella upgrade? The combination of the Shanghai and Cappella upgrades – what does it accomplish? And why is it such a big milestone for Ethereum?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, of course. So Shapella, as you have beautifully explained, is a combination of Shanghai and Capella. So Shanghai executed four core EIPs on the main net, whereas Capella brought some specific changes on the consensus layer. So these four EIPs were \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eEIP-4895, 3651, 3855, and 3860.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe rest\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e three EIDs, which starts from three, most of them are for EVM upgrades, EVM changes, and there was this 36511 coin base, which was a tool to make gas cheaply, cheaper for contract developers, however, EIP 4895, introduced a system level operation to support validator withdrawals. Withdrawals were the key change for this particular upgrade. So many people may know that Ethereum moved into proof of stake back in 2022 with the merge, but the proof of stake work on the chain started back in 2020 with the release of Beacon chain.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe shift towards POS already happened in the past two upgrades. However, it closed the loop with the Shapella upgrade. So in 2020 when it was introduced it was unidirectional; people can only add ETH, become a validator and have their reward in the wallet but that was not realized. Shapella upgrade enabled accessing those rewards and validators can now go in and come out freely. If they want to stay they can come out with partial withdrawals and if they want to completely exit they can come up with the full withdrawal. So that's what the Shapella upgrade brought to the Ethereum Network.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAwesome. Thank you for the overview. And I would love to focus a little bit on withdrawals because they were one of the big headlines of this upgrade from what you just shared. And, of course, there were worries, folks had of initial rapid outflows after the upgrade. But just .3% of all 18.1 million tokens staked were actually withdrawn in the 12 hours after the upgrade based on data from Nansen. And so tell us a little bit about your perspective on withdrawals. Are you surprised at the low withdrawal rate? Why do you think stakers are keeping their Ethereum? What do you take away from all this?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThere are a couple of things about it. I think that can be my perspective, which I would like to share with you. First of all, like, when people were trying to activate withdrawal, there was this validator credential change that has to happen before they can enable their withdrawal. So far, only 72 people validated credential has been updated, right at that time, when withdrawal, when this upgrade happened 40,000 credential changes took place. So that is the first thing, the first blocker for validators to withdraw because they have to first be able to change their credential. A message was signed, and many of the validators have already done it, but some of them are still in process. That's part one.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe other two parts are that the Ethereum chain has a churn limit like not everybody can withdraw their money at one point of time, at the same time. So they have to go through a process cue, there are certain limits for the partial withdrawal per day. Similarly, there are certain limits for full withdrawal per day, we try to maintain this protocol there. So we do not put the security of network for a concern at any point of time. There should be a good flow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo that's there for the second thing. And the most important thing, which I think is with this Shapella upgrade, obviously many validators were able to take out their XX the reward that they have earned over a period of time. And this gives confidence to many others who were planning to take out their money, or were planning to get into the system. So I think the Shapella upgrade gives a lot of confidence to existing and new validators to continue doing their duties as a validator on the network.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAwesome, appreciate that rundown. Talking a little bit more about just kind of the withdrawal risk and helping people understand the theory and how it works. So, about 16% of all the ether supply has been locked up in the protocol for staking as of earlier this month, you talked earlier about the Ethereum chain having a turn limit and not everyone being able to withdraw at once. So, what would happen in theory, if stakers decided to withdraw a lot in a large portion of that?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLarge portion here can be the maximum that they have earned plus the deposit that they have made on the network. I think the average is somewhere around 34 ETH per validator on the network as of now. So, if again, the validator decided to take out all that means they are making full withdrawal at any particular time that they are willing to make that withdrawal and they are signaling about it. With the process of withdrawal there is another process going on in parallel is becoming a validator. If we take a look at the chart like I had data for the month of February, we have a good amount of validators also getting in.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo, with that churn limit, we definitely do not see the network in threat at any point because they would not allow too many validators to come out of the chain at any single day. And at the same time, there are validators who are also getting into staking as I mentioned. I am taking a look at the dashboard by Metrica which is supported by Ethereum. So, if we can take a look here, you can see that as validators are coming out, they are also getting in so security is there. The loop is closed, which means the function is working properly. So I think people will be getting confident only instead of losing that and when they decide to come out you know, they also have limited options.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhat they can do with the Eth they want to take out either they can trade it to you know, get into some other cryptocurrency or in cash that or they can keep it in their own wallet like E-wallet but there's no point keeping it with them in their wallet and not doing anything with that. There is another option that is coming up is like staking with the help of a liquid staking pool. That's another option. But again, with a liquid staking pool, people will also come as validators into the system. So yeah, I don't see a threat yet. Obviously there, there's a lot of confidence getting in.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight. And for those on the call, who are perhaps less familiar with Ethereum and ETH staking, can you talk a little bit about what the incentives are for people to keep their Ether staked even now that the Shapella upgrade is complete?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo, the minimum requirement is if you want to become a solo staker, of course, the minimum requirement is 30 ETH that you have to deposit on the network. However, if you do not have the study of ETH, there are multiple options available in the ecosystem. You can go with as I mentioned, like the liquid staking pools. So, for becoming a solo staker also, you need to have a set of, you know, technical help also to run both nodes execution node and consensus node on your own like on your on your home or wherever you want to do that and make sure that they are online at all points of the network.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHowever, if you are not technically skilled enough to participate in the network as a solo staker, you can definitely take advantage of the staking services provided there are different kinds of staking services liquid staking is quite popular, because that also gives you the advantage of making use of the Eth while you have already staked like there are like they provide a token that pool token that you can be using in place of ETH. So there are other services, I think going with the services is a good way to get involved and make money. But if you want to make a real contribution and want to learn the network more, it would be a good idea to do solo staking. There are 10 clients available, five on the execution side and five on the consensus side. And they all have discord channels, they are willing to provide all kinds of support. So that's always less risky. But yeah, there are multiple options people can use.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGot it. And do you anticipate the unlocking of staked Ether and the rewards that will be paid out is going to attract intensified regulatory pressure from the SEC or how do you think about that and the change that just happened?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u0026nbsp; We are aware Kraken and Coinbase are definitely having some regulatory pressure right over there. But I am not sure if that's because of the unlocking of ETH that could be with their process like the way they would like to operate in the United States. This depends on the government. But I highly doubt that locking unlocking will in any way affect the government policy over here because locking unlocking is an individual's choice and if they are participating in a blockchain that depends on the government of that location where he or she is living, right? So I don't think they’re interrelated. That's what I meant to say here.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah. All right. So zooming out a little bit, just into kind of Ethereum’s journey more broadly. How does this upgrade position Ethereum for more long term success and mainstream adoption?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight. So, as I was mentioning, like Ethereum, proof of stake was kind of a dream for Ethereum people who started them back in 2015. They always wanted to have proof of stake. It took time like it took a lot of years to be here. Finally, we are having a full cycle of Ethereum validators here. I think now we have a complete system built up. Now what we need to do is improve the present system. We need to improve the present blockchain and that's what is our next priority.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo the next upgrade that we are hoping to have would be based on scaling obviously, the proposal, inactive discussion and maybe ready for dev nets as well is EIP 4844. That will help layer two projects to maybe interact with the chain and be able to scale Ethereum transactions as well. So that's next.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd I think there could be few other improvements to be done. We would probably propose builder separation to try to make it more decentralized to the set of validators, proposers, relayers so we can make sure that security is never at threat. But if we talk about a system and ecosystem that can be, you know, running in parallel or the present ecosystem, Ethereum blockchain has already provided that with the Shapella upgrade.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight. And zooming out a little bit more to kind of more of the mainstream adoption piece, do you believe that Ethereum will eventually surpass Bitcoin as the most dominant cryptocurrency and what do you think is still left? What would it take for that to happen?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSurpassing Bitcoin – that's an interesting question. I would like to share my take on that. So I believe that Bitcoin is the number one currency because of its total market price like shares that it contains, as well as the value that it has, right? But if you look at the user, you would see Etherum\u0026nbsp; has more distributed users. Multiple projects are running on top of Ethereum blockchain. Projects are trying to interact with Ethereum Blockchain. So I'm definitely confident here that Ethereum may, in the long run, be ahead of Bitcoin definitely in terms of user base.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePrice wise, it's hard to predict because a lot of things are associated with it. Ethereum transactions require gas, we are trying to figure it out and gas is again, the ETH there. So a lot of things to be taken care of. I am not in a position to talk about the price. But from users perspective and mainstream adoption. I think it's already ahead in the race.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, awesome. All right. Well, before we wrap up Pooja, anything else you'd like to share or anything else we should be aware of coming up for the Ethereum community?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI would say that people need to be here, if we want this to be the most decentralized network. Ethereum has a good user base, but this contributor base can never be enough. We want the mainstream people to join us and for that they have to join and make the contribution in the way they can make. There are multiple opportunities Ethereum protocol gets into a lot of research – there are a lot of research findings going on.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIf you would like to learn more about Ethereum, pick up the topics that people are working on. Join us as an intern. Ethereum also has this EPF - Ethereum Protocol Fellowship program, join those programs if you are a developer, if you are a researcher or a PhD institution, reach out to contribute your research work. There's a lot of opportunity to get involved. Obviously, you can make money by becoming validated and earning rewards as well. And trading is another thing, but you become a part of the network, by your way, the way you like.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo, look forward to what we are doing here. There's lots of new changes coming up as I was mentioning about 4844. Account abstraction is already out there EIP 4337 so wallet and these types of smart contract developers can start taking a look at this proposal and may implement it in their projects. There are a lot of opportunities out there. Stay tuned. All the best to everyone. I hope Ethereum will become a big success with the help of you all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAwesome. Thank you Pooja and before we drop, if folks want to follow you, where can they follow you to hear more about what you're talking about with respect to Ethereum? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjam: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAs I mentioned, I'm a part of Ethereum Cat Herders. So ETH Cat Herders discord is one of the best places where people can come and chime in and share their questions, comments, concerns related to Ethereum blockchain or Ethereum protocol.

It's called the Solana Saga - big announcement for the company. Solana announced on Thursday that the Saga is now available and will be shipped on the 20th of April for those who pre ordered and open for orders on May 8 for everyone else.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHere to discuss the new phone and really how it might be able to revolutionize web3 itself is Anatoly Yakovenko. He's the co-founder of Solana and CEO of Solana Labs. Anatoly, thanks for being here. Great to have you.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Thank you for having me.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOf course. So let's begin with the most obvious question, at least to me, why the need for something like Saga right now in the marketplace?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWell, if you've ever imagined what crypto should be like, once we actually get to full adoption, you can imagine that world with a phone that's not your hardware wallet, it just makes sense. Right? Like it's the device you use every day, it has all the technology necessary for signing and transactions to be secure. It's just not enabled yet. So myself, I spent most of my career at Qualcomm and some of my closest colleagues worked on the technology that we're using to enable this. They literally built the Snapdragon trust zone. So as soon as I started working on crypto, it was just always in the back of my mind, when are we going to enable this on a Qualcomm device. So I'm pretty excited to actually get this to market and the level of security that this provides, I think, is so close to what a mobile phone could do, in terms of being a hardware wallet. So I'm really excited to bring that to consumers.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd to the point about bringing that to consumers. Talk to me about how you envision this new look, web3 experience to be especially on a device, an Android device and, and something like this for people who have some familiarity, but are pretty eager to learn more.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo we want to get the experience to be as kind of slick and exciting to people as and seamless as what you expect on an Apple Pay, or the Google Wallet. So when you sign transactions, you just tap the fingerprint scanner, and it automatically detects your fingerprint, does a biometric checking inside trusts out in a secure environment, and that signature happens and your transactions go through. The nice thing about doing this in Solana is that it's cheap and fast and it feels like you're using, you know, Google Wallet or Apple Pay as well. So you're own experience is kind of a slow network effect that you do on a theory or other networks.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut there's more. I think one of the fundamental reasons why this is necessary isn't just the security part, it’s actually the applications part of the web3 DAP store that Solana released as well. There's a bit of a fundamental difference with web3 business models, that doesn't really work with web2. When you own web3 content, you actually own it. You own those NFTsYou know, when you own music that you bought from iTunes, you don't actually own that music. It's still Apple, so you can't transfer it. You can't sell it on eBay, right? You can't give it to your kids, in theory. But then NFTs, you can actually own those digital goods. So that just doesn't really quite work with the App Store models, like applications, like magic eaten in their iOS app, they can't list the digital items that are for sale in their marketplace, at 30%. higher price in the iOS App Store because they don't own that content. They can't eat those costs internally. And they can't list it higher because there's no way somebody's gonna pay $30,000 for an NFT in the Apple App Store, if it's available for 10,000 bucks on the desktop, that's just never gonna work.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo there's a bit of a conundrum there. How do we get the app the big app stores to change those policies and to actually re-script to let these new business models, you know, be discovered and for people to figure out how to monetize them in a way that's fair to everyone. So I think we're taking that first step to really enable that for consumers and developers to see what happens.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnatoly, was it always part of your your calculus or your dream to have a separate Solana App Store, especially given how the App Stores of today, Googles and Apples have very strict payment system rules and to your point, one of the big headaches for developers, of course, is this 30% figure and a lot of the rules and regulations under the companies that basically control the market share of the space, at least up until now.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWell, you know, Solana is a platform. It's a platform for developers. So I talked to developers all the time, it's just kind of my day to day, probably half of my day is spent talking to external developers that are building some applications. And I would say their number one concern is how am I going to get these web3 features through the Google approval process for the Apple approval process? So as soon as we started gaining traction with devs, this was always something that they brought up. So immediately it became something that I've kind of always had in the back of my mind.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDo you expect web2 companies to try and do something like this? You did a good job a response or two or go laying out some of their challenges, but is it your expectation that even the web2 kind of legacy names will be forced to sort of adapt?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI would love to work with every web tech company that's thinking about this, and with all the tech we built is open source, we will gladly work with them to do the engineering work for them to start leveraging this platform. That would be awesome.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHave you, if you don't mind me asking, have you had any conversations with any of those names?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNothing deep that we want to announce yet.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay. All right. Fair enough. I'm a journalist. I'm just asking the questions I'm sure you understand.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, give me your sense. Give me your sense about why this has not yet been done already and why is Solana the right foundation for mobile, and of course your for more mainstream adoption?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI mean, it's probably because I'm the founder that worked at Qualcomm for over a decade. So I knew exactly what pieces of technology we needed to build to ship this. So it didn't take a 100 person team. It was a very small team of labs, you know, I think about five to seven engineers that we got the ball rolling to get this out.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd Solana the network is really well suited for the mobile experience, users really can't wait, you know, 10, 20, 30 seconds, let alone minutes for transactions to settle. That has to happen within one to two seconds, and it has to be so cheap that for the mobile experience, developers can actually pay for the user.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo if the unit economics for using these web3 applications have to be so low that you can start doing the same kind of adoption, you know, product market fit loops that you see on mobile applications today. And that means users don't actually care about what network it’s running in- they don't deal with gas costs. And all that stuff is kind of hidden behind the scenes for them. And for that to be possible, the network has to be cheap, as fast as to be scalable. I think Solana is the only one that really fits that bill right now.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAny close competitors you have who might launch a competing phone or something like that, not even on your radar just yet.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, it's not even on my radar. Anonymously, everything we built is open source. I think we would love to get contributions from anyone on the Ethereum community or Bitcoin community to add support for those networks.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhenever you talk about mobile pay operations, this opens the doors to a conversation for general security questions, security concerns. Talk to me about the assurances, and really the work that you and your team have had to do with regards to privacy considerations, especially for any person out there who might consider getting involved, but say, hey, when it comes to mobile pay operations, you're really dealing with some pretty intimate personal information.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo as everybody knows, public permissionless networks are public by default. So any transactions that you do are recorded in a public ledger. So this is something that folks need to be mindful of. And there are technologies to make transactions more private, like elusive is a technology that does as your knowledge proof when you want to do transfers and things like that. So you would have to intentionally use those technologies. And because all of those are available as smart contracts, it is really outside of the hardware wallets kind of domain to take care of the wallet, the only thing that it provides is the secure signing capability. But everything else you can basically access via smart contracts.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHow many pre orders do you have on the phone? What does interest look like?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBefore we launched, we had about I think 5,000 pre orders, we were targeting developers and from my perspective, it was..our DBT units that we shipped are very well received. So we have a very excited developer community that loves the device.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo it sounds like that was largely your expectation about that 5,000 number. And again, keep in mind, it's early, right? We're not even quite yet at the shipping distribution phase of it, but you get the sense that that largely matches the excitement you had hoped for for people?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Yeah, so the thing is that like, I've worked on every major phone launch at Qualcomm, like as an engineer, remember the Amazon Fire the Metro phone from Microsoft. It's very, very hard to launch a phone with a million units sold on day one. And this is actually I think ..this was never our time, when you look at daily active users on\u0026nbsp; the most popular web3, networks like applications like OpenSea, it's about 10 to 20,000 people that generate 20 to $30 million of volume per day. So our goal is to actually get the most heavy web3 users on this device. And because there's no restrictions for web3 content on this device, that's a better distribution channel. If you can target those 10 to 20,000 users directly as an app developer, that's a much better distribution channel than the big app stores because of the restrictions. So that's really what matters. Can we get the right users?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd how about targeting users that may not yet be too involved with the web3 space? I think at this point, most people, if not everyone has heard of it. But as you know, not everyone has necessarily felt confident as of yet to dip their toe into the market. You do a great job laying out the case, I would argue in terms of going to that core constituency that you know, we'll be supportive. I think your pre-order numbers suggest that, but how about other people that are sort of on the sidelines? Is this something they might be able to consider, if not now, for potential future application?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThis is an awesome Android device on its own. It's built by an amazing company, the founder literally designed the iPad Pro. I mean, like when I worked at Qualcomm, and I would compare the phones that we had to iPhones and I was always like, why can't we have nice things. This is like the first phone that I feel like the build quality is better than Apple’s.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo I would suggest that anyone that's like, loves phones and wants to check out Android, we've literally I think the first time that I've ever seen people tweet on Twitter, I'm going to switch from iPhone to an Android device because of this. So I would genuinely recommend that people go check it out simply because it's an awesome phone. And then maybe if they're curious about crypto, check out those features too.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnything like this is undoubtedly a huge labor of love. Talk to me personally, what most excites you? I can only imagine here, right, but just covering enterprise and covering big companies, and covering people with big ideas for a living. There's such an emotional part about this. It's such a deeply personal thing you and your colleagues are undoubtedly pouring all of yourselves into this. What most excites you personally about this, that you would want someone watching this interview to take away?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOh, man, yeah, we literally call it chewing glass. But the process of launching a product like this, we had to chew a lot of glass. What I love about it is I think all the ideas that we have, and all the dreams that we have about having this like full web3 adoption with privacy, and people with self custody, having full control of their funds, of their digital content, it's all kind of coming together. And it’s all.. the technology is there. It's possible, and the user experiences can be wonderful. It could be joyful, right? You're using Apple Pay or any other Google Wallet experiences, but now for crypto.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo that to me is really, really exciting. And I want to see people that are so excited about the applications that this is the best reason that they get this phone. They're not just curious, but they actually see somebody that built something that gives them so much value that they want to go get this phone and then enjoy that.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI mean, you work in this space, you're on Twitter as much as I am, if not more - so you know, web3 has its fair share of critics. What do you say to people that may still be on the outside and not they're not on the outside, because they just haven't learned enough to get involved, they're on the outside because they have learned a lot and they are firmly in the camp of being adversarial to a lot of the efforts that you're describing?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI think their skepticism is very warranted and welcome. And I think it's going to take a lot of work for us to prove that there is real value here. And I think that's very fair to say, like we haven't yet seen an application and crypto in web3, that has broken out to consumer success that everyone's using it on a day to day basis.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo we're trying to kind of like remove all the speed bumps for developers to get there. And that's a lot of work in and of itself. But I firmly believe in the idea of self custody, that you own these cryptographic keys that are secured with math, and that gives you tremendous power to transact and coordinate with people online. It's a very powerful thing – it expands to human human rights, right? That's maybe a bit too much. There's much bigger problems in the world, but it does empower people to go do really cool things on the internet, so I think that's awesome and I'm excited to see the kinds of applications people build.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd then talk to me a bit more about especially for people that are kind of accustomed to having a more traditional provider, let's say an AT\u0026amp;T or Verizon - what does this look like specifically with Helium 5G? First, a lot of mobile, especially if you're introducing some names that some people, not all of your demographic base, of course, but some people are only really learning about for the first time.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e I mean, if you're a wireless network nerd, this has got to be the coolest thing ever. Because, you know, all these massive networks, they're effectively almost like government mandated monopolies. These are very big companies. They require licensing from the FCC and a lot of work and deployment to go build, build these towers and deploy these towers and everything. And Helium is doing it from the ground up, basically volunteer driven, and people are doing it for tokens, which are like, you know, more or less doing it for fun, right? They want to see if this will actually work. And I believe Helium was at about 8,000 5G cells, and these are like four GCB, you know, 4G+ CBRS spectrum band cells, similar to what other folks call 5G as well. If you want to get technical, there's a bunch of differences, but it's a high quality network at like 8,000 cells. AT\u0026amp;T and Verizon, I think are about 50,000 cells.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe United States probably needs like a million. These are the estimates that I've seen before people talk about online. Some will say as high as 10 million to really get wall to wall coverage. So there's a lot of work left to do for the big carriers. And I think there's a very good chance that Helium passes them. And like overtakes and is maybe the first one to actually get to that, you know, 500,000 or a million number of like 5G cells in the United States. And that would be awesome. That means a bunch of volunteers coordinating with cryptography, right? Just with a bunch of math on a public blockchain, we're able to outpace in very critical infrastructure for United States for communication. I think that would be the coolest thing that's ever happened, I think in technology.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou told me earlier about the number of pre orders.

Obviously, it would be amazing if we were 10x that. And that would be awesome, but we'll see what happens. It's very hard to build phones, we build a really great device. But you know, it's very, very hard to sell phones. It's a very competitive market. So we'll see what happens. Startups are here to take big swings and take risk.

I'm Sarah Evans, Founder and CEO of Sevens PR as always, it's important for me to acknowledge I am not an investing expert, but I am a passionate and gracious learner with a focus in the tech industry. Let's jump right in. Today with us is Ari Redbord, Head of Legal and Government Affairs at TRM Labs to discuss crypto regulation and the road ahead in 2023. Thanks so much for joining us today.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u0026nbsp;Sarah, thank you so much for having me. Exciting to chat with you.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah Evans:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e I feel the same. I always learn so much. I joke that this is my informal master's degree in all topics.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAwesome.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah Evans: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo crypto regulation discussions have been at the top of agendas for regulators across the United States after the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, leading to investors losses of close to $10 billion. This is a two part question for you. But we'll start with part one. Can you give us some insight on how regulators in the US seek to provide more revenue, literary clarity in a current chaotic industry?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIt's a great question and really pretty much the most important question today in the US. I will say sort of to start things out that globally, the landscape is a little bit different. We've seen regulators and even policymakers really around the world lean in to sort of digital asset regulation. Even just yesterday in Australia, we saw the Australian government come out with a framework that could potentially ultimately be sort of legal clarity for digital assets in Australia. We saw the same this week from the UK,\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI think the US is a little different, right? We haven't seen a lot of activity yet on Capitol Hill that could provide real legal clarity to businesses on key definitions, you know, what is a security versus what is a commodity when it comes to digital assets. What we have seen is a lot of activity out of the executive branch, right? We've seen an executive order on digital assets, we've seen a number of enforcement actions, there's been a bunch of sanctions actions by the Treasury Department against, you know, bad actors in the cryptocurrency space like Russia based exchanges, and dark net mixing services and other types of things. We've seen a lot of enforcement actions from the SEC. And finally, we've seen a number of different criminal prosecutions that have gotten a lot of headlines from the Department of Justice, quite frankly, including the SPF, and FTX case.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo we've seen a lot of talk on Capitol Hill, but we definitely have not seen a lot of legislative activity. I'm hopeful that as we kick off 2023, we will see some activity. I still don't think a lot but hopefully at least around stable coins, which I think will be the first place we'll see some regulation, because there's some consensus around the fact that stable coins should be backed one to one in order to protect consumers.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah Evans:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Thank you. That's really good insight. Although the FTX fraud was crypto related, much of their success in avoiding regulation came from the sheer fact that they were not based in the US. Should regulators be focusing on fixing international regulatory law instead of maybe blaming the crypto industry for the fraud?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWell, look, I think the nature of cryptocurrency, right? Cross border value transfer at the speed of the Internet means that there's got to be some consistent standards across different regulations. I'm not naive enough to think that we're gonna have some sort of global framework for crypto, but I think we could have some more consistency. And I think we're actually starting to see that build out. Even I mentioned, Australia and the UK this week, a lot of similarities between the two frameworks. And then you look at the EU, which really has led the way with mica, the markets and crypto assets, legislation, that is really the first clear, comprehensive framework for digital assets. So we're starting to see some consistency. But I think the reality is, you're going to have jurisdictional arbitrage, right? Bad actors. And businesses are going to look to jurisdictions where there's not regulation, and try to build there.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo I think, you know, I talked to a regulator recently, who said to me, Look, we're only as strong as our weakest link here. And that is absolutely true. I will say that the FTX is an example of the US sort of using that extra territorial jurisdiction or the fact that US users were on those platforms to really rein in a non US based crypto business and apply US laws. And I think you'll be able to see that as long as US consumers are engaging with these platforms globally - but there's no question it is harder.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah Evans: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThank you. Crypto leaders like SPF were leading the way and giving a framework to governing bodies to provide a more straightforward path forward to regulation. After the shocking collapse of FTX, how has this affected previous regulatory plans in the space and part two, how has this affected other crypto leaders' influence within the US government?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, no, it's a great question. There's no question – I live in Washington, there's a lot more skepticism here around crypto than there was about FTX or the collapse of FTX. And I think a lot of this is almost starting from the beginning. I think quite frankly, what I was excited about for 2023 was a real focus on defy you know, how should we regulate or think about policymaking in a truly decentralized world, when we don't have intermediaries?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI think that FTX has set that back. And the conversation has gone back to well, how do we regulate, you know, fraud in, in, in centralized exchanges? Like FTX? And I think the reality is, and I think you got to this a little bit with your question is, you know, the fraud and FTX did not occur on blockchains. This was not an issue of the technology. It was very much an issue of bad actors, the same as Lehman and Enron and other types of cases that have plagued the centralized financial system for really generations. And I think that there are laws in place today to deal with FTX. And I think we've seen a lot of those play out, right? Securities laws, fraud, civil and criminal statutes. And I think we'll continue to see more of that.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI think what I'm excited about is policymakers really talking about, you know, how do we regulate this cryptocurrency ecosystem differently? And I think we've pushed back, that timeline has been pushed back, because there's a lot of skepticism today in Washington.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah Evans: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI'm really glad you made the distinction between bad actors and bad technology. I think it's a really important distinction point. Moving on, there is much discussion on who will lead the way in crypto regulation in the US with Congress, the SEC, and the CTFC fighting for the head role. Can we expect a key regulatory figure in the industry? Or do you think new rules and laws will come from multiple governing bodies? And followed by could this dispute lead to a longer roadmap for new regulations in crypto?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou know, I think it's probably the most important question facing the space today, because it's not just who's going to regulate. Businesses need that regulatory clarity in order to engage in the US. And I think we're not going to have that until we have our definitions straight. You know, what crypto assets are securities, which are commodities, you know, which are financial instruments, and sort of, and really sort of set out a framework. And I think the reality is, it's going to be some time before we have that. And what we're going to continue to see are these sort of, you know, people call it regulation by enforcement, it has sort of a negative connotation, but the reality is that regulators are going to act with the authorities that they have, and they don't have legislative authority, they have enforcement authority. So we're going to continue to see the SEC continue to take action and the CFTC continue to take action until there is clarity between sort of what is what is the commodity and what is the security? And \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo finish addressing your question, I think, ultimately, we will see different regulators play different roles in this ecosystem, you know, we don't have one financial regulator, as they do as the Monetary Authority of Singapore, for example, right? We've always had the Fed, the Treasury, the SEC, the CFTC, and I think they're all going to play a different hand in this, but we're going to need Congress to act and to the regulator's credit, they've all said that, right? The Fed, the SEC, the CFTC. They said, we need Congress ultimately to act and the White House, you know, can put out all the executive orders they want, but you're gonna need legislation eventually.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah Evans: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYes, great point. Apart from the FTX collapse in 2022 many other platforms and projects experienced chaotic collapses, including stable coin, Terra Luna. In an industry where much regulatory clarity is necessary, what segment of crypto is at the top of regulators agendas? And when do you think we can expect to see the first set of crypto regulations in the US? I know, it's a big question.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, it's a big question and is a great question. And I think, you know, look, I think the collapse of Terra was really the first really global collapse of one of these sort of important crypto players. And it really caused the world, the EU, UK, Singapore, Dubai, and even the US to talk about how do we regulate the stable coin space in particular? And I think, as I mentioned at the outset, I think the one thing we may see this year from the US Congress is, is legislation on stable coins. And I think it's because A, they play an important part from the stability perspective and the ecosystem. But I also think it's the place that there's the most consensus on, right?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe industry, and policymakers pretty much agree that after Tara, you're going to need a one to one reserve backing of these stable coins with this sort of fiat or stable asset. And I think we're seeing that consensus. I thought we were going to have legislation come out of the House Financial Services Committee on this last Congress, but I'm hopeful that sort of early this Congress we’ll have something because that is really, really been a focus. So I think stable coins is probably the answer.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eEven if you look at the UK framework that came out yesterday, stable coins was in that sort of high risk category that regulators and policymakers are really focused on. So I think if there was one area, that would be it, but I think that there's probably a number of others that we could see discussion on. But I think, you know, look at post FTX, I still think we're in still this world of discussing the risks and the challenges with crypto, less about sort of what the the possibility of the technology, which is, quite frankly, what I think we should at least be talking about as part of this.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah Evans: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat. I do want to dig in also on what you do and TRM’s labs, how do they work to create a more compliant and safe place for users in an industry with numerous gray areas? I'm really interested.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, no, thank you so much for the question.\u0026nbsp; You know, look, the unique qualities of public blockchains, right? Transparent, traceable, immutable, allow regulators and law enforcement and crypto businesses to trace and track the flow of funds to monitor transactions in ways that were impossible in the fiat system. So what we do is we are a blockchain intelligence company at TRM and we work with law enforcement regulators to do investigations to track and trace the flow of funds using our software. And then we work with financial institutions and cryptocurrency business is really across the spectrum as an anti money laundering solution. You want to make sure that bad actors North Korea's terrorist financiers, cyber criminals are not engaging with your platforms and crypto businesses and financial institutions use our software as an anti money laundering solution.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSarah Evans: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWell, it's completely fascinating and Ari Redbord, I want to thank you so much for joining us today.

At Tema, we're trying to be very thoughtful about kind of the companies that go into a particular theme and also the themes that have long-term durability. So $TOLL or the monopolies and oligopolies ETF, basically investing companies that operate in monopolistic or oligopolistic industries. And this is kind of, you've probably heard the Warren Buffett term moat. Think of this as kind of an ever-expanding moat with crocodiles in it that hopefully lasts rather than kind of a couple of years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd that's sort of the idea behind it. And it's all about quality companies within it, right? Rather than maybe necessarily going just for growth, which a lot of thematics tend to do. So I took a look at some of the companies that are listed. This is as of June 30th in the public disclosures, Yuri, you've got, I think your top two holdings as of that point in time, included the credit rating agencies, you've got S\u0026amp;P and Moody's in there. And then you've got a number of French industrial companies. I saw that your weighting's France, you know, France is about 15% as of that point in time. Take us through some of those names. Again, you've got the rating agencies. What are some of the others and why are they in your ETF at the size that they are?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, absolutely. I mean, look, what we're looking for are companies that operate in an industry that is essentially either has one, two, or three players maximum, which are concentrated where there's essentially monopolistic or oligopolistic structure. So if you take the credit rating agencies, there are three in the entire world. And in fact, really there are two, S\u0026amp;P and Moody's effectively control most of the market between them. There's also Fitch, but it's a kind of smaller player, more distant kind of third player in that market. Similarly, with the French industrial company, so we own Airbus, which is a manufacturer of airplanes. And as we all know, there are only two manufacturers of airplanes in the world. There's Airbus and Boeing. And so we've gone for Airbus in our portfolio. Essentially that kind of gives you a flavor of the types of industries we're looking for, right? Two players really concentrated market share between those two players. And that creates a lot of really fascinating dynamics because one, we believe that this industry structure is going to maintain for a very long time. So if you take aerospace, right, what you get there is this is a highly regulated industry. It takes forever and costs a lot of money to develop a new airplane. People have tried different manufacturers before, but nobody's really succeeded apart from Airbus and Boeing. And that's because safety is really important. It takes ages to certify and test a plane and to develop one to make a lot of money. And so that's the kind of durability of that monopoly that we think will endure over a long, long period of time. And it's a similar thing with credit rating agencies. What's happening with them is they get as they rate more and more companies, they get more and more data and information about other companies. And that maintains their advantage because for competitors to come in and recreate that database, it's going to be very, very difficult to do. That advantage maintains for a long period of time and in it creates really fascinating kind of financials, which we think benefits the stock price over the long term.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, let's talk about that, Yuri. Is it necessarily the case that having a high amount of concentration in an industry does translate into, for example, decent growth, not use the term aggressive growth for some of the other companies out there? Let's just say decent growth for these companies, above average margins, strong free cash flow. Are those characteristics you always see in the kinds of industry structures that you're talking about?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, I mean, it's a fascinating question, right? I think what the most important metric where it kind of comes out is probably return on invested capital, which is a moniker of high quality companies. So all of the companies that operate in monopolistic industries tend to have higher returns on invested capital. Now, obviously, you know, our funds tries to select the best monopolies, ones where there's sort of durable advantage over a long period of time. And that means that necessarily maybe you'll have a monopoly where you have high returns, but the companies don't say invest in a new innovation and squander that advantage. And over time, industry structure collapses because new competitors come in. Because remember, it's a competitive capitalistic market, right? So people are always trying to go after this high, they see these high returns are like, oh, I could have a piece of that. And they try to enter. And so what we're looking for are monopolies that are very strong, right? They're taking some of these cash flows and not instead of enriching their shows or reinvesting back into their business and creating stronger and stronger modes. And that's why you can't just kind of pick a few of these companies and hold them over the long term. You want to be able to spend a lot of time analyzing and understanding the ones that are going to be very durable over a long period of time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eYuri, walk us through a couple of the factors that create these monopolistic or oligopolistic structures in the first place. Regulation is one, you've already pointed to that with respect to Airbus. What are other sources, create of the kinds of moat you're talking about?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, exactly. And that kind of gets to the heart of what a monopoly is, these sources of competitive advantage. And if you read the industrial economic literature, or you know, you've sort of been in the stock market and look at businesses for long enough, you can kind of find five major sources of competitive advantage. Regulation is one. So think maybe even patented pharmaceuticals or some of these things that I've talked about in the aerospace area, you have a high switching costs. So that is if a customer there's an extreme cost for me to switch. Aerospace is a perfect example of that, right? Once these parts are certified, for example, if you're a supplier to Airbus, like we own an engine manufacturer, once that engine's been certified on that plane, it's going nowhere. It's not gonna be replaced by a competitor anytime soon. And that high switching cost is effectively why the monopoly persists over a long period of time. Then we have network effects. So that is where an additional user added to the network, creates so much value for the other users, it grows the value of the whole network for everyone who uses it. And a perfect example of that is a financial exchange, right? The more people trade on a financial exchange, the more liquidity there is, the higher the value to any individual user. And that network effect builds up a big value for that particular monopolistic industry like exchange. We can get onto how those dynamics play out over time in some other industries like tech. You also have economies of scale. So that is where how you build up enough sufficient scale that the individual unit cost of production goes down so much that no competitor can come in and compete with you. Semiconductor manufacturing is a perfect example of that. There are only a few companies that can manufacture the most leading edge semiconductors, which are by the way the most efficient way of manufacturing semiconductors. No one can compete with them on cost per transistor. And so therefore you have this advantage that other people can't get and it will take a very, very long time for them to reach, created almost impossible in some cases. And then the final one is kind of non-replicable physical assets. So this is where you have a physical asset in the physical world that you can't create again. Railroad is a perfect example of that. In the United States, you currently have six class one, which is large railroad companies, that effectively divide the whole country between them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah. What's an example of that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK:\u003c/strong\u003e...building, recreating that railroad network is virtually impossible. I mean, you'll never get the permission for what you will. And so, you know, one thing you can almost say with certainty is that in 30 years, it will be the same railroad companies that are around us now. Exactly, you can't replicate those particular assets over time. And so you've effectively created a, sometimes people refer to in the literature as a natural monopoly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eIf we're not flying around, they're not going away any time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK: \u003c/strong\u003eSo those would be like the five forces, right? Regulation, high switching costs, economies of scale, network effects, and non-replicable physical assets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, let's dig into one sector that has shown elements of those, you know, some of the five, not all of the five, but just gets a ton of coverage as a result. And that's the tech sector. And, Yuri, when we think about even the fact that the Magnificent Seven, right, is called the Magnificent Seven, there's a number around, there are acronyms around it, shows at least when it comes to capturing share of the public exchanges as concentration. And often that's because those companies themselves have achieved some of those monopolistic or oligopolistic benefits that you've described. Social media is one of those sub-sectors of tech where we see this kind of concentration in terms of the numbers of players. Let's dig into that a little bit. I mean, talk a little bit about what made those monopolies as clearly network effects, but why has it been so hard to disrupt the social media space?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's fascinating. I mean, we get asked about the technology sector a lot because, you know, obviously spending a lot of time looking and understanding where monopolistic industries, we're actually of the view that the technology sector is very difficult to actually say there are real durable long-term monopolies. And remember, I'm talking decades here and not necessarily the kind of a couple of years or even 20 years for that matter. And the reason for that technology is almost synonymous with disruption, right? And so sometimes you'll have what might appear monopolistic structures, but suddenly some new technology will come along and completely disrupt and change the whole paradigm. Yeah, so TikTok's a perfect example of that. One of the fascinating things about TikTok, if you dig into its history, is that one point in 2018, TikTok was taking 25% of all Facebook ads on iOS devices in the United States. I mean, just let that sink in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eLike TikTok. Like TikTok just came into that, yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK: \u003c/strong\u003eA quarter of every four ads, one of them was a TikTok ad. This was when TikTok was nothing. So they used Facebook's network to build their own business and the results were staggering, right? I mean, if you look at the number of minutes people, especially younger people use and spend on TikTok versus Instagram or Snapchat, it's just, you know, the charts gone this way, right? And they built this advantage by using Facebook's network that Facebook has effectively given to them through these advertising dollars. And this speaks to another really interesting point about media and social media in general. They're all competing for our time, right? And time is actually quite a limited resource if you think about it. We all have how much you work or if you're Elon Musk, you have many more hours or whatever. You have 18, let's call it, or 16 hours in the day. If you're not sleeping that much, that's it. And that's what these media companies are competing for. And so that attention means that it's a much more competitive market than a market for dollars or freight or whatever it might be that kind of has infinite potential to keep growing and get bigger. The other side to this is advertising, right? Because what they're trying to do, these businesses, especially in the tech space, is they're trying to go for advertising dollars. And what I've found fascinating over the last kind of five years is companies that you would not necessarily associate with advertising have chosen advertising as their kind of new revenue stream. And the reason I bring this up is if everyone's converging on the same advertising dollars, that makes that pool of advertising dollars much more competitive than any other pool of money around. So if you take like Uber or Instacart or Amazon, you know, if you look at a typical Amazon page right now, most of that page are advertisement that other people have paid for. That to me is telling me that advertising dollar is not going to Google or Facebook, it's going to Amazon. And o it creates this competition and suddenly Uber is advertising on the app and Instacart is advertising retail when you're trying to buy your groceries. And so you're competing for the same dollars because it's a limited amount. Sure, it's growing, but it's a limited amount of money that you have. And that's why we think these areas like social media and search and kind of software are probably a lot more competitive than people give them credit for.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eIt's interesting to dig into something that you almost said in passing there, Yuri. It feels like the ad dollars going to the Amazon and the Instacarts and the Ubers is because the advertisers know that there's at least a moment in that very precious thing that you identified, which is time. But there are eyeballs captive and concentrating, right? They're moving away from a social media tab or they're moving away from watching streaming or whatever it is we're doing to actually focus on that transaction and that point in time. So Yuri, when you look ahead, when you look into a crystal ball, and it's an unfair question, which is always the most fun kind of question, where do you see new platforms coming up in the tech space that are going to be successful in capturing my attention in yours? And perhaps it's not necessarily clear they're doing it yet. They may sneak up on us, but where do you have a sense that you've got some emerging players in that space?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK: \u003c/strong\u003eThat's really interesting. I mean, I think what's coming out of this conversation, at least in our minds when we analyze these markets, is one thing I can tell you for certain, there's something's gonna come, right? The disruption that happens in the tech sector, it's kind of synonymous with its kind of existence and its nature. So I don't know specifically what platforms are gonna come up, but they certainly will come up, right? So we've had a wave of virtual reality, right? That could be a new thing, right? Remember, the metaverse two years ago, everyone was talking about that. Now, I think these things always go through a hype cycle in technology, right? They get hyped up, everyone talks about it, gets excited. Usually a really bad ETF launch is related to it. And suddenly the excitement dies off and suddenly we... But the technology doesn't go away and people keep working on it and keep analyzing and keep thinking of new ways. And suddenly it's on the scene. And remember, this disruption keeps happening faster and faster, right? Take the example of chat GPT. Now, it took chat GPT five days to get to a million users, right? Instagram, for example, two and a half months to get to that same number. And if you look at historic kind of services or platforms, as you say, that are vying for our attention or our time or our use in the technology space, they're progressively getting faster and faster and faster in terms of how quickly they come and capture our imagination or our use. And that's the nature of the technology sector. That just doesn't happen anywhere else, right? No new railroad is gonna pop up in the US all of a sudden.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, let's dig into that and go, let's go full circle here in the conversations as we close out together, which is to that point, $TOLL, the ETF that you and the team have put together specifically to find the winners where there are monopolistic or oligopolistic characteristics. If I look at your top 10 holdings, you don't have a lot of tech in there and you don't have any in your top five. So if we go back to those five sources of competitive or monopolistic advantage that you identified earlier, Yuri, again, network effects, switching costs, economies of scale, regulation, nonreplicable physical assets. I know you've written a blog about this. It feels like listening to you as though you can almost rank them in your mind, right? Because the technology of social media play that we discussed is very heavy on network effects, right? There's a huge amount of reliance on that for those monopolies. Am I hearing or furring that perhaps the nonreplicable physical assets Monopolies are sort of your favourite in that line up. Maybe regulations, is there a way that you order them? And again, I'm just trying to play back to you what I've heard in the course of our conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, absolutely. I mean, that's how we think about constructing monopolies. We always think, like, what are these sources? Can I identify these sources? And more importantly, are they really durable? And I think physical assets always is kind of the contrarian statement here, right? Because very few people associate technology with something physical in this world. But that's really where we are finding kind of the monopolistic businesses. So take, for example, semiconductor equipment manufacturing. These are companies that have spent a very long time developing some very, very advanced technology. And over time they've concentrated so that in certain processes within semiconductor manufacturing, there might be only two companies that do this in the whole world. In fact, it actually houses the one absolutely true monopoly that exists in technology, which is a Dutch company called ASML. Now, ASML builds the leading edge lithography machines for semiconductor manufacturing. And just to give you a sense of what this is. It's a four, three, four story machine. Okay, it's three to four stories high. It costs $300 million. It has a sphere of glass in it that if you were to blow it up to the size of the earth, it wouldn't have a dent less than sort of like one centimeter in it. It's like perfection of technology. And ASML is the only company in the whole world that can do this. It's taken it years to develop this stuff and it's selling it to its customers. It's a hundred percent monopolist in this space. But again, it's a physical thing that they've created and built. And that's why we think that that's an interesting area where there's not that much competition in the technology space. The other areas where you can combine the digital space with something tangible, like a support work, or as you said, regulation. So we quite like the tax preparation software space. You think that that's related to, you know, a technology, but actually to get taxed, you need a support network of individuals who are experts in tax. Over time, that support network is really what drives the value of that particular software and the competitive advantage versus any new entry that might come in. And that's where we think kind of the real, maybe gems, hidden gems in technology of monopolies are, and probably not in the...\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eThat's fascinating. Let's talk a little bit about that tax preparation one, because H\u0026amp;R Block, you know, would be an example of that, Uri, but this is also one where just to push you a little bit, the IRS has at least announced, we'll have to see how quickly it rolls out, that it wants to have its own e-filing, you know, and software offering out there to make it more accessible to taxpayers. Is that something, is that a scenario where you could almost say, oh, look, the regulator is disrupting the provider?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK: \u003c/strong\u003eThat's really interesting because obviously one of the things that happens in monopolistic type industries, which tax preparation, there's only a few players actually, the one we own is Intuit, not H\u0026amp;R Block. And H\u0026amp;R Block is a bit more in the old world of actual physical tax preparation in terms of people going into offices, which we think the best. Exactly. It is a support network, but there's no technology attached to it. So for me, what I like about Intuit is you have the technology of tax preparation, but you also have a call center and real support helping people prepare these taxes. The IRS, so governments is something we have to watch very carefully always in the monopolistic space because one, governments often don't like monopoly power. Now, all the monopolies that we invest in, sometimes they get, you know, people think that they're bad, but the truth is they've arisen because they've given a lot of value to customers over time. And if we pick the right ones, they're the ones that have not necessarily taken a huge cut of this particular value and the customers have accrued most of it. The IRS obviously looks at this and says, well, Intuits created a ton of value for people to prepare their taxes, but we think there should be a, you know, the government should also allow easy filing because we have all of the information. Then there was a bill passed, some money was spent on this and investigate the report. It's expensive for them to create that system. There's a lot of political, like, fighting over this particular thing, because in general in the United States, there's a view that the government, it's taking your taxes. Should it really be telling you how you file your taxes as well? So it's a big political divide. And so in general, what I see there is quite a limited risk. They already have free filing. So for individuals who have very simple tax returns, they can file for free with the IRS anyway. Exactly. And so the question is, why? And it's not like tax preparation software is that expensive. It's a couple hundred dollars. So is it really worth the government's resources? And what's happened is that you've seen the IRS bill actually defund this particular area. So the risk is starting to go away.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eInteresting. So many interesting insights coming out of this conversation.

So super grateful to have you here. and hear a little bit more about how this last quarter went for you. So thank you so much for joining me today, Charles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCharles Gillespie: \u003c/strong\u003eThanks, Kinsey. My pleasure. We've got a great Q2 in the bag, so happy to answer all your questions about it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eOf course. Yeah, let's jump right in. You know, you mentioned that we had a great Q2. It was last week that Gambling.com Group. And one more time, that ticker is $GAMB. You released your second-quarter earnings. There were some pretty big numbers in there. One that certainly stuck out to me was that revenue grew 63 percent. So I'd love to hear your perspective on how that increase came to be. Tell me a little bit more about some of the factors that influenced that growth in revenue of 63 percent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, as many of your listeners will know, online gambling, in particular sports betting in the United States, has really kind of exploded over the last couple of years. And that's what drove the increase. So we grew North American revenue by 115% to 13.4 million. So that's over half of our nearly 26 million in revenue for the quarter. And that's where pretty much all the growth came from.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eSo as sports betting and online gambling has become more popular, I would love to understand a little bit better how you differentiate yourself from what I imagine is a growing cohort of competitors. Tell me a little bit more about what that strategy is for differentiation in an industry that is growing at a pretty rapid clip across the board.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, we differentiate ourselves from the other publicly traded companies in the United States in the online gambling industry by simply having a different business model. We are not an online gambling operator like Fanduel, DraftKings, BetMGM, Caesars, et cetera. Those companies are actually our clients. So as you see them advertise everywhere they can and try to grow those businesses, they're spending a chunk of that money with us. And therefore we are growing much faster than the market in the United States, but we essentially offer investors a way to play the secular growth in online gambling in the United States without having to pick a winner. You know, is it going to be DraftKings? Is it going to be Fanduel? Well, it's going to be all of them actually. But where, you know, we will have a very nice business in the U S regardless of who ends up at the top of the pile.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eSo I'm curious about with all this being said that you have this unique perspective having exposure to some of the other bigger players in the space, in the gambling space, the online gambling space specifically. Tell me a little bit about what areas of the industry you're paying the most attention to right now. You know, that could be any particular sort of pockets of the market that you're watching, especially just as we're headed into the back half of Q3 and the rest of this year. Are there any parts of the online gambling industry that have been growing really quickly, that have been catching your attention, that you are feeling ready to share about?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eSure, yeah. The main thing that's driving a lot of our business and the other companies in our space in the US is these new state launches. The next new state to launch is Kentucky. They're going live with sports betting on September 28th. So for us, that's mainly a Q4 phenomenon. We'll get three days of revenue in Q3, but it's really gonna hit us in Q4. We updated our guidance last week when we released earnings and the way we manage these new states is we don't add in the effects from these new state launches until the launch specifics are crystal clear, which in the case of Kentucky, they now are. So we added Kentucky into the guidance for revenue and in particular that took us to a range of 100 to 104 million. So we now expect to generate on the low end, 100 million in revenue this year. The next state that's gonna go live is North Carolina, which is very exciting for us because we're actually from North Carolina. Me and the co-founder, Kevin, were both born and raised in Charlotte, both went to UNC, and Kevin now lives back in Charlotte running our North American team. So North Carolina is gonna be fantastic for us when it finally comes online. There's no launch specifics yet, although we estimate it'll be Q1 of next year. And therefore it's not in our guidance. Well, we haven't actually introduced any guidance for 2024, but, you know, the way the analysts are modeling things out, you know, we've been clear not to add in any of these new states and as in when we get specifics on the, on the launch in North Carolina, we'll quantify that and, and that should show up in the analyst reports.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eAll right. And in terms of state-by-state legislation, I'm curious about how the momentum feels right now. Does it feel positive? Does it feel like there are any big headwinds in terms of legislation to legalize vetting in these states? And with that in mind as well, what are your thoughts on anything at the federal level? Are there any expectations that you have around that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah. My hope and prayer at the federal level is that they do absolutely nothing. This has become, and it frankly always was, a state's rights issue. And if the feds come in and actually try to do anything, it could be great or it could be horrible. If they mess it up, they mess it up for all 50 states, which from the kind of industry's perspective, that's putting your eggs in one basket. We're quite happy to have everything done on a state-by-state level because that allows for more variance. Certain states can try different things, different models work better than others. At the state level, they fix their mistakes much more quickly than at the federal level. So to the extent a state regulates online gambling in a kind of boneheaded way that doesn't help anyone, then they can go and fix it the next year. So we're quite happy with that state-by-state approach. You've already got over 25, over half the US has got regulated online sports betting. The next wave we expect will be online casino games. You've got a handful of states now that have online casino games, but that's really where our business will take a big leap forward. If you think about the profitability of online casino versus online sports betting, it mirrors what you see in a land-based casino. Okay. If you walk into a casino in Las Vegas, the sports book is tiny and there's a football field or two worth of, of slot machines. Uh, and, you know, that's for obvious reasons. They make a lot more money off the slots than they do off of the sports book. And it's no different online. Uh, so as we get new States coming online for online casino, that's, you know, really the heart and soul of our business, we do very, very well with sports betting, but we have historically done even better with these online casino games. And when I say that, I mean, helping people find online casinos, right? You know, again, we are the comparison shopping site to help people find these sites, we don't actually operate the online casino games ourselves, but, you know, we bought casinos.com, the domain name at the end of last year, which from our perspective is the single most desirable domain name to have in the industry. We relaunched that in July. So there's a brand new website up and running at casinos.com. And we think that'll be a big part of our growth over the next several years is that becomes as big as gambling.com in time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's certainly interesting to think about how sports betting, to your point, being available legally in half the country right now might sort of lay the framework for the scaling of online gambling in a more pure-play sense of the word. How does that manifest in your business? You know, tell me a little bit about how the experience with sports betting over the last couple of years has informed any plans to scale into the online gambling space once that becomes the conversation du jour as we're talking about legalization.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah. Well, you know, our corporate history is we kind of come from the online casino side. So we, I wouldn't say we've learned a whole lot about online casino over the last several years. More than we've learned about online sports betting is that's become a very meaningful part of our business. But if you look at it from the political standpoint in the US of actually regulating these activities, there's a pretty clear path. So step one, they regulate retail sports betting, you know, not online. You have to walk into a physical store somewhere, interact with a human or some sort of kiosk, and then you can make your sports bet. They realize after they do that, that they completely miss their revenue targets in terms of what they expected to make off of regulating that new activity because it doesn't scale. It's an individual location. Maybe there's a couple locations, but it doesn't have the same economics at all as an internet-based business. States will then come back to it and they'll add on online sports betting after having started with retail. Then they make a bit more money. It, you know, they become, they make some meaningful progress toward their revenue objectives for regulating online gambling, but they're still not there. So the next thing they then do is regulate online casino games. You know, in one state having this conversation right now is New York. You know, they, there were semi-serious conversations earlier this year about the prospect of actually regulating online casino games in New York and, um, you know, New York's a big state. It's, uh, it's, it's going to really move the needle when they finally do that. Uh, but these conversations, they take a couple of years, you know, the first time someone proposes this, it doesn't even get off the ground, but then they propose it next year. And people actually take it a little more seriously and they have a proper debate, but it doesn't go all the way through. And then the third year, yeah, they're more familiar with the issue. They've heard some of the arguments before. It's not as scary as it used to be. And it makes, you know, you can make a real push at actually getting this stuff approved. So, you know, just because you get a state considering, you know, online casino and it not going through. It's actually a sign of progress. And, and, uh, in time, we think quite a few, if not. The majority of states in 10 years will actually regulate online casino games.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, certainly some very interesting insight to consider the sort of the growth curve, right? So, you know, you mentioned Kentucky in the back half of this year, potentially North Carolina in early 2024. What else would you like to share with investors as you head into Q3 and beyond? Anything else that's top of mind right now?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, the start of football is a big deal for us and the rest of the industry. You know, we've got a lot of great assets out there, but one of the newest assets that we have is the usatoday.com website. So we've cut a strategic media partnership with Gannett, the company that owns the USA Today. They're also the incidentally, the largest publisher of newspapers in the United States. And what we do there is we help them monetize online gambling, sports betting and casino in exactly the same way that we do with gambling.com and our other websites. So for USA Today, if you go to usatoday.com/betting, that's us. That's our content, our technology, our advertising, all of it. And what we do there is create that compelling content, put it onto the usatoday.com website. We help them. We help Gannett drive a new audience into the website as well, a high-intent audience, users that are keen on opening up new sports betting accounts. And then we monetize it. Basically, we pass that traffic along to the operators under our commercial agreements, and we share the economics with our media partner, Gannett in that case. We've done a lot of work on that to get that ready for the start of the NFL. And that deal was only announced at the beginning of this year. So it's a relatively new deal, and we expect to kind of see it come into its own in September and in Q4 with NFL. Obviously, that's one of the biggest drivers of engagement in sports betting, and in particular in setting up these new accounts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eAll right, well, certainly an exciting time to have this chat. And it has been so wonderful to hear a little bit more about how Q2 was, and what the expectations are for Q3 and beyond. So Charles, thank you so much for joining me today. I really appreciate your time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eIt's great to be here Kinsey. Thanks again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eWith that, thank you once again to our guest, Charles Gillespie, CEO of Gambling.com Group. Thank you so much, Charles, for joining us. And thank you to all of you for listening. We will be back soon with even more updates from the sports and gambling world in no time.

I'm your host Kinsey Grant and I am so excited to be here with you today. Now before we jump in, I'd like to thank our sponsor, SinglePoint. SinglePoint ticker S-I-N-G on OTC Markets is a renewable energy and sustainable lifestyle provider. And we're thrilled that they made today's interview possible. Now today we are going to talk about a majorly hot topic that has been driving and yes, pun intended, plenty of conversation in business and investing in recent years, electric vehicles. I'm so happy to welcome our guest today. itselectric CEO, Nathan King. Nathan, welcome to Public. How are you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNathan King: \u003c/strong\u003eHi, Kinsey, I'm doing great. Thanks for having me.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eOf course, I'm thrilled to have you here we have a lot to cover. And I'm excited to learn a little bit more about what you're doing, what your business is doing, what your vision for the future of electric vehicles and electric vehicle infrastructure is. And I think as we get started with that conversation, it would be good to start with a little bit of context. itselectric is a startup that's building a new model for EV charging stations. But I gather, that's just the beginning. So Nathan, could you start by telling me a little bit more about your business? And about the challenge for which you're solving?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNK: \u003c/strong\u003eSure. So itselectric is an EV charging company, and we're exclusively focused on cities. And why is that important? Well, there are at least 40 million drivers in the US that parked their cars on city streets, they don't have access to an off street, parking garage or a driveway. And the beauty of what we do at itselectric, is we allow that very urban density that creates barriers for EV charging in cities actually to become our solution. And what we do is simple. We find spare electrical capacity at the adjacent privately private property and we pull that electrical supply out to the curb side to power an EV charger for any driver in the community parks their car on the city street. Why would a building owner let us do this? Well, what we do is we share revenue from that charger back with the host property. There's no upfront cost to the owner. itselectric pays for all the electricity that we use. And even with a low or modest utilization that host property can earn around $1,000 a year. So it's really it's a win win for for everyone involved. The host property can bring EV charging to the community. EV drivers now have an opportunity to have a place to charge where they're already parking their car. And for cities. This is a privately funded solution. So we don't have to requisition money from city budgets or state budgets to get EV charging. Infrastructure deployed. Right.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eSo using what's already they're using what's already there exactly. Got it. And I gather that this is kind of part of the the solution to one of the bigger question marks or one of the bigger problems that a lot of people who have tried to understand EVs or at least how we get to mass adoption of electric vehicles. One of the big things that we talk about is range anxiety, that that feeling of not really knowing how long you can go not knowing if you're going to find the appropriate kind of port to charge or know all of that anxiety that comes along with can I make it where I need to go? Will I be able to pull over and do what I need to do? Tell me a little bit more about how that range anxiety is, is coming to life in these urban areas where you're deploying your tools and your business. Tell me a little bit more about how range anxiety plays out for people in those more densely populated parts of our country.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNK: \u003c/strong\u003eSure, and and, you know, we acknowledged that range anxiety is going to be something that drivers think about, they imagine themselves stranded in between two cities and not able to find a charger. But because we're a sort of city focused EV charging, we're actually concerned with something that we call accessing anxiety. So if you don't have anywhere that you can find a charger to plug in and in charge your car, you're going to think twice before you buy an electric vehicle so that that access anxiety actually becomes your primary consideration before you buy an EV. And, you know, most drivers and cities, they don't put that many miles on their cars, and they use their cars for their daily commute. They're not really driving from city to city. And so really what they're doing is they're, they want to be sure that they have a convenient and accessible location to charge their car when when they need to. We we know from the Department of Energy that about 80% of the electricity that powers EVs is done at home. So a typical EV driver, they'll have their own garage or driveway, they'll have an electrician come in and put a decent charger so that they can charge their car overnight. That's, again, that's 80% of how charging is done in this country. And that other 20% are when people are driving long distances, like I said, in between cities, or maybe they happen to go shopping, and they go to a public charger, and they hop off their car if they're having a busy day. But really the easiest way and the most convenient way. And the big advantage around EVs is that you don't have to go somewhere to fuel your vehicle, you plug in, let it charge overnight. And when you come out in the morning, you're you have a full you have a full battery. So that kind of charging behavior is what we want to unlock and enable for city drivers. It shouldn't just be a luxury that drivers and suburbs have.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, absolutely certainly certainly makes a lot of sense. And I would love to hear a little bit more about the community focused approach. You mentioned that this feels like a win win for both the drivers of EVs for the cities where we want more EVs to be on the roads, and also for the communities where you're entering into, you know, their their market their neighborhood. Tell me a little bit more about how you're trying to align incentives with these local communities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNK: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, you know, this is, this is a little bit comes from my background, before starting It's electric. I work as an architect and I worked on big complicated projects, in cities across the US. And one of the things that we learn as architects is that if you are building a big project, in a particular neighborhood, it's disruptive to the people that live there. And so you really need to make sure that you have some buy in from the community before you start that project. And you know, architects do this by making sure that the buildings that they design fit the context of the neighborhood, they make sure that they're in many cases, that there are things that are set aside in the actual building for the community to use, you know that that's like a, like a community center, or a place that people can gather and or cafe to eat. If you don't have that buy in from the community, when you're working on an urban project, your project will get slowed down, or it might not happen at all. And so we really tried to bake that understanding into how we think about its electric and put that into our business model. And so this idea that actually, we're going out and working and making partners with property owners in the communities that we're working with, that's how we are trying to sort of engage the engage the community directly, people who are hosting our chargers are literally our partners in that deployment. The other thing that we've learned is, is that the design of what we're doing is very important. So I mentioned, it needs to fit the context of the city that we're working in. So our chargers are actually designed to be very minimal. We don't have really an EV charging company in this country right now, that has designed something to fit and operate exclusively on a city street. What we have in this country are things can look like gas pumps, communities aren't really going to want to see things like that from their homes and businesses. So in order for us to scale up, EV charging, it really needs to be small, it needs to be compact, it needs to be durable, and it needs to fit in with the existing landscape. So that's our that's really important for us as well. We're designed and community focused approach to evey charging, yeah, certainly makes a lot of sense.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd one question that I would love to get your perspective on because this is quite frankly, something new that I didn't understand. I live in New York City, I don't have a car I rarely drive but you know, it's it's something that I have only done once been in a car that has had to pull over in charge on the way down from upstate one of those long city to city drives. But I didn't know that there are certain types of cars that can only types of EVs that can only charge at certain kinds of chargers. And this idea of interoperability is still a question mark for EVs. Tell me a little bit more about where you stand on this idea of interoperability knowing that multiple different models of car can maybe use the same kind of charger?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNK: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and it's one of the things that I think that the EVindustry needs to work on a little better. You know, if you go by an internal combustion engine car, it's very straightforward in terms of how you can fuel it right, you know that you're going to find a gas station, you're going to sit there for, you know, a few minutes to fill the tank, and you understand how far you can go. And every car more or less works that way. With electric vehicles, though, it's much more complicated. Not every charger works with every car, not every charger is the same speed. Sometimes there's very big differences between the speeds of chargers, even when they're sort of publicly available. And so the industry right now is really trying to straighten that out. But the complexity there is ultimately going to become something that EV drivers will appreciate, because it gives you more options in how you can fuel your car. And so we are trying to watch the industry try to make these sort of distinctions and charging a little bit smoother. But right now what we have are, you know, in the same way that in the early days of cell phones, you had different kinds of chargers that you had to use to power the battery. I mean, I think that's still the case. Some days, like sometimes a new iPhone version will have a new charging port that you didn't have before. We're kind of in those early days with EVs. And so really, there's there's two standards in the US right now, there's the one that Tesla uses. And there's the one that everyone else uses. And that makes it even more confusing is that you can get an adapter, right. So if you're a Tesla driver, actually, you can get an adapter and use any charger that you know the chargers that the other cars use. But if you're a Hyundai driver, or if you're a GM owner, you can't use a Tesla charger. So it that kind of thing needs to be sorted out and thought through. There is some hope on the horizon, though, there was really big news in the EVindustry last week, because Ford announced that they're going to start adding Tesla's charger to their vehicles. So in a few years, Tesla, and Ford will be able to park in charge at the same chargers. And so now we're waiting to see Oh, is that going to sort of happen with other vehicle makers as well? Is, is Tesla going to open up their network? And for EV drivers, you know, we would hope that that happens, because actually, Tesla has an amazing network all across the country, they put a big investment in developing their EV charging network. And for other drivers, that network isn't quite there yet. The reliability and the number of charges that are out there aren't quite where Tesla drivers have so you know, between what's happening in those other companies and between what's happening in Tesla, we think we can get there. But the industry is still kind of like I said working out which standard to use, who is allowed to use what chargers? And in terms of that standardization is the does the onus really fall on the automakers themselves, Tesla would have to say we're opening up our network or Ford or GM or Hyundai or insert carmaker here, it's on them to decide we're going to tie in with, you know, insert some other carmaker and use the same infrastructure. Yeah, you can imagine it's it's, it's an engineering decision, right? Like do we have to change the the charger type that we've already invested money into. And you also have to imagine that they're thinking, Well, I'm going to be giving more business in a way to Tesla, because now my drivers can are basically paying Tesla for evey charging. And so there's a little bit of a competitive consideration that they have to consider as well. So strategically, they have to decide you know, what's more important and you know, reassuring our drivers that they have more places to charge, or making are trying to create our own category around charging. For us as for at itselectric, you know, we have a couple of things that we think about with these different standards. One thing is our charging hardware is based on a European model where the cord actually is not attached to the charger. And that's one of the ways that we keep that the design of our charging hardware down to a minimum. So drivers carry their own charging cord around with them. And when they charge, they take the cord out and they plug it in. And when they're done, the cord goes in the trunk, and all you're left with on the sidewalk is a nice clean piece of hardware. It protects the cord from the elements and from vandalism. And also for us if there is any damage to the cord, we can very easily replace the cord and we don't have to roll a truck out and have the charger serviced. So operationally it keeps our charges up longer. And the other advantage that we have with the detachable cord model is that we can give a cord to a Tesla driver or we can give a cord to anyone else that has the same standard and doesn't need an adapter. So that's one of the things that we think about in the in this changing industry landscape making sure that drivers will have these options.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eWhether no matter what kind of vehicle they drive, all right, yeah, certainly makes a lot of sense. Now, I want to talk for a second here about a pilot program, I believe you recently announced with Hyundai, tell me a little bit more about this, this partnership, what's what's going on? How's it going to work? What's it going to look like?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNK: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, we, we launched this pilot in April. You know, we're a startup, we've only been around for about a year and a half. And in that time, one of the things that we really worked hard on doing was developing this relationship with Hyundai. And Hyundai, I think saw an opportunity to work with us. Because what we're going to do is, by putting a charger, in a city, where people don't currently have access to charging, you're unlocking a new market to these drivers. And Hyundai makes cars that work really well in cities. In fact, that's the kind of car we drive. So you can imagine that, you know, if we can get these 40 million Americans access to charging, you know, that's a whole new market that that's now opened up to the Evie manufacturers. And what Hyundai did was basically work with us to help us fund the installation of six chargers here in Brooklyn. A couple of them are sorry, a few of them are here in the Brooklyn Navy Yard where we have our headquarters. And a few of them are at a place called the Brooklyn army terminal, which is in Sunset Park Brooklyn. And what we've been doing is sort of a closed pilot, we kind of closed pilot, we invite drivers in, they come in and they use our chargers, they give us feedback on how our hardware is working. And if they have any issues with the detachable cord model. And in that way, we're able to sort of test out this sort of unique kind of model that we're doing. It also allowed us to do the installation, see how much it costs, see if there's any, in any issues that crop up around, you know, once you actually start doing something out in the field, you know, issues come up that you have to address that you couldn't have predicted. So that really, that relationship has been very helpful for us, not only because they helped us subsidize the installation costs, but also because we learned a lot of lessons along the way along the way that will help us as we begin to scale up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, certainly makes a lot of sense. And I imagine that those lessons will become more and more valuable, the more scale you acquire. And with that in mind, I want to take an eye to the future here and think about what comes next for itselectric. Tell me a little bit more about what you specifically are expecting from the future for your business, but also more broadly for EVs generally speaking. What do you see as some of the big themes that are cropping up that you're identifying as things to watch?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNK: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, that's, that is a great question. And, you know, as I said before, like, the industry is changing on a weekly or monthly basis. And one of the things that's been true since we started kind of thinking about its electric a couple of years ago, is that the market demand for EVs keeps exceeding expectations. EVs are very popular. People that get them love them and never want to have a gas car again, regular regulations have come. In the last few years regulations have gone into effect in California and New York state that's basically phasing out the sale of new internal combustion engines by 2035. And the the at the federal level, legislation has come across that is really targeted to incentivize the deployment of EV, charging infrastructure, and offset some of the costs that new EV drivers might have, especially in the early days. And so what we what we expect to happen is kind of what we see happening in Norway, where 90% of new vehicles are electric. In the Netherlands, 40% of new vehicles today are electric, and our niche of the market these 40 million drivers that we have identified, they're going to need 4 million chargers to be installed at least to support their driving behavior. Right. So that is the market opportunity that we are pursuing these millions of curbside chargers that we know need to be deployed in order to enable this transition that consumers are interested in participating in because they want EVs and cities and states are interested in pursuing because it's going to help them meet their climate and sustainability goals. And we think we can be a very significant part of that, because we've developed a model that really lets us get out to scale very quickly, you know, again, by this community and design-centered approach.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah. All right. Well, Nathan, this has been wonderful. I really appreciate your time and your insight and telling me a little bit more about itselectric and what you're working on. And the EV space, broadly speaking, has certainly been a wonderful experience. And it's been great to hear a little bit more about your story. So thank you so much for joining me today.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNK: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, thank you, Kinsey. It's been great. I really enjoyed our conversation. Thank you so much for the opportunity to help us spread the word. We're really looking to get\u0026nbsp;as much attention to this issue around charging in cities as we can so thank you so much.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eAbsolutely thank you everybody for listening that was itselectric CEO Nathan King.

I'm your host, Kinsey Grant and I am so excited to be here with you today. This episode is going to be super informative. We have a stellar guest here to talk about online gambling and sports betting and earnings headed right your way right now, Charles Gillespie is Chief Executive Officer, Co-founder and a Director at Gambling.com Group. That's the ticker G-A-M-B. Gambling.com Group is a leading provider of digital marketing services for the global online gambling industry and was founded in 2006. Charles. Welcome to Public, how's it going?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCharles Gillespie: \u003c/strong\u003eThings are going very well. Thanks for having me on, look forward to sharing our great story with your audience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I'm excited to hear this story and I think that framing it as a story is really the way to start here. So let's hear a little bit about the beginning of the story. If you will, I want to hear more about your company. Do you mind giving me just a brief overview of your business model?Tell me a little bit about how your business works.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, sure, no problem. So, what we do for the online gambling industry is basically the same thing that, say Hotels.com does for hotels. So if you wanna go to Paris, you're not gonna go to 10 different Parisian hotel websites to find a hotel or you're gonna go to hotels dot com or booking dot com or something like that and get all the information in one place and make a decision there. So, we basically do the same thing for the online gambling industry. So if you're gonna bet on sports and you're in, let's say Massachusetts, (just because Massachusetts just launched sports betting) there are a great many different places you could play at, online in Massachusetts, which are now legal and regulated. And, it, you know, our typical users that go to Google, they search for something like top Massachusetts sports books, they'll find one or more of our websites: we've got betmassachusetts.com, we've also got gambling.com, bookies.com and a lot of other sites, they'll find one of our sites, they'll find the information they're looking for. So, you know, top 10 sports books in, in Massachusetts and then they'll click and leave one of our websites, go to one of those sports books, register deposit play. And then we get paid, and, and what we do is called performance marketing because we only get paid when the traffic we send to these, online gambling companies performs when they actually sign up deposit in play. And if they don't, we don't get paid anything. And that's the the nature of the performance marketing model.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eSo tell me a little bit about, you know, the, the bigger picture that's going on here and we'll get into earnings in a second. But I imagine it's been quite a, a transformative time and, you know, momentous several years for, for your business and for working in the space in which you work with the advent of, of legal gambling and legal, online gambling and sports betting in all, all sorts of different states. Tell me a little bit more about how you view that momentum's impact on your business.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it really has been a, a hell of a couple of years, but we started this all the way back in 2006. Myself and, and the COO we both went to UNC, we're both from North Carolina. And, we wanted to start a legal and proper business in the online gambling industry, even all the way back in 2006. And back then, there was no legal online gambling in the United States. So we left, and we ended up building this business in Europe. Our largest office has been in Ireland for a number of years. Our largest market has been the UK, for most of the history of the company. And, then in 2018, when the Supreme Court unblocked sports betting, across the US, we had to turn the ship around and point it back at the US and, and really kind of come full circle. So, we've seen this industry grow and grow and grow and we understand how early it still is in the US and kind of North American regulated online gambling market. You know, a lot of people look at New Jersey, which has had, online casino gaming for nearly 10 years. And sports betting for, you know, five years and they think that it's, it's done or it's mature or that, you know, everyone's already signed up for all the, all the online sports books already and there's kind of, you know, it's not gonna grow and, and we know that that's not the case. You know, we've seen big markets like the UK Ireland, even Sweden, Italy, you know, just grow and grow and grow, you know, 20 years after, they first regulated. So we see an incredible situation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eRight. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eYou've got this, this industry which is high margin, high growth and booming all around the world, which basically did not exist in the United States for regulatory reasons. And then the doors have just been kind of flung open in 2018. And now you've got a majority of states with regulated sports betting. You got a handful of states with online casino and more are gonna come every single year. so you, you've taken, you're going from this situation where regulated online gambling in the United States was sub a billion. And, I don't even know what the latest figures are because it changes so quickly. But, you know, it's, I don't know, it's, you know, estimates are 40 or 50 billion in, in, you know, another five or 10 years, which is crazy. I mean, it, you can, it's impossible to think of another, industry where you've gone from sub a billion to 50 billion in the space of, you know, 10 or 15 years. So it, it really is an incredibly exciting industry. We do love this industry and, we're very happy to, to be bringing this business back to the United States. And of course, we did the IP O in 2021 which was, you know, we got the picture on the, on the wall behind me here. That's, that was clearly one of the big, one of the big days in our history.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I, I can imagine there is a, a ton of excitement and it seems to be a theme, you know, with all this momentum in mind, I want to talk about earnings. You reported earnings late last week, tell me what are three things you would want investors to take away from your most recent earnings report.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eKind of three big lessons. So uniquely within the online gambling industry or at least within the publicly traded companies in the United States that focus on this sector. You know, basically, all of them are high growth but, but very few of them are profitable and very few of them are very profitable and we are both high growth and highly profitable. So, year-on-year growth in the quarter was 36%. Virtually all of that was organic growth. There was a tiny contribution from one month of an acquisition. But, you know, then we also had adjusted margin at 40% and free cash flow of over six million, you know, so we actually make money, you know, in, in, in kind of sharp contrast to a number of the more high profile names in the sector. Which obviously gets a lot of attention. And, and because of that, I think it's, it's, really a unique business. But, the thing I'd, I'd also call out is, look, we grew 33% year on year in North America.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eOk.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd that's against Q one last year, which had the monumental launch of sports betting in New York State, which, you know, I'm sure there's more than a few people listening to this from New York you know, the finance community there is, is great and very into sports betting and it was kind of all the rage in, in Q one last year and, and obviously that drove great results for us a year ago. And despite that kind of blowout number, those blowout numbers in North America a year ago, we still grew 33% year on year in North America, this Q one. But on the other side of the Atlantic and our other kind of main segment in the UK and Ireland, we actually grew 36% year on year, which is even faster than North America, which, again gets back to this idea that this industry keeps growing for a very long time, you know, they regulated online gambling in, in the UK in about 2005. And it, you know, and it, the industry is still growing the affiliates, you know, companies like us performance marketing companies, they're continuing to occupy a kind of bigger and bigger part of the player acquisition within the whole sector. And companies like ours are continuing to take market share within the affiliate performance marketing space. So, you know, to me it's, it's, it's really surprising that we grew even faster in the UK and Ireland, than North America. But, you know, they're both high growth and, and that's perfectly fine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I think that this, this hint at this larger idea that, you know, you, you started this conversation with the story of your company, the story of this industry. I'm curious about whether this last quarter one that you, you know, just reported earnings for, does this impact the bigger picture story for your company at all? Does this change anything for you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eI think Q one was, it was like it was a record quarter. But, you know, as a high-growth company, most quarters are supposed to be record quarters. So I think, you know, there wasn't any strategy shift or any sort of, I, I think, I think what was a remark about the quarter was just, it's, the fantastic numbers with us just focusing on the business. You know, there was no acquisitions, there was no, nothing out unexpected, nothing out of the ordinary and, and, and we still drove as strong of a performance as we did.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, totally. So, with all of that in mind, I wanna understand a little bit more about the future and hear your perspective on the future. So we'll take a second here to kind of pivot to look ahead. Tell me a little bit about the rest of this year. What are your priorities look like as a company through the rest of 2023?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eGenerally speaking in North America, we focus on, a couple of things. So new state launches are very important for us and we had a number of new state launches last year. This year, they're, we're not expecting to have any new states launch before the end of the year. And that's, you know, that's a very helpful tailwind. But despite that, you know, we've put out very, healthy guidance at the beginning of the year and we've already raised that guidance on the back of the Q one report that we had put out, last week. So, you know, even without new state launches, we're targeting revenue of, 90 where let me make sure I give you the exact, the right numbers here, the, the, the 95 to 99 million, you know, so, knocking on the door of 100 million this year.  And, if we do get any new state launches, you know, because Kentucky is regulated, you know, North Carolina, is probably going to regulate, you know, do the legislation in the next kind of 23 weeks. We're very positive on North Carolina, it's an important state for us. And when those states after they legislate, then they actually need to publish a timeline to launch. And once we have clarity on that, we will add it to the guidance because there's nothing in the guidance now about new state launches. So when we know North Carolina is going live, when we know Kentucky is going live, then we'll, we'll be able to, to tell the market and, and adjust. But the other thing I really, have people think about, and what we are really focused on for the remainder of this year is our new media partnership with Gannet. So Gannet is the largest publisher of daily newspapers in the United States. They publish USA Today, you know, which is the only kind of truly non-business national newspaper in the United States, with a very good sports section. And we have partnered with Gannet to help them monetize sports betting. They know that they've got a huge opportunity with all these different digital media properties of theirs and this great big audience and they came to us to help them, maximize the opportunity and, and, and basically make money off of this industry. If you look at it from our perspective, you know, when we try to grow the business, we can, we can add content to the websites. We already have, we can build new websites, we can buy websites or we can partner with websites and, and that's what we've done with t so, now if you go to USA Today.com/betting, you'll see our content. So that's all us. We've built, you know, essentially this kind of mini site of sports betting information and, and we, you know, pipe that into USAtoday.com and that should be a pretty meaningful driver of revenue, into the end of the year, especially after the start of NFL. So, as you can imagine, the start of the NFL season is really the kind of coming out party, for, for sports betting, every year. You know, it's a, it's a time of the year when, people set up a lot of new accounts, people obviously bet on the NFL more than they bet on anything else. And, you know, being in position at the beginning of the autumn sports season is very important for all sports betting companies, including ourselves. So, we expect to be in a good place in September for that autumn season.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, certainly, very interesting. And we'll, we'll have to check back in, in September too and I've got one last question for you here, Charles; you've talked a bit here about, you know, the, the bigger story, the broader industry trends and contours that are, are driving gambling as an industry right now, sports betting as an industry right now, I'm curious to hear your perspective on when, if at all, there is a tipping point, you know, you mentioned that the growth you're, you're seeing in Europe, in the UK and Ireland is still significant and still in some ways surprisingly significant, right? But I'm curious about if, you know, there's a point at which that growth might begin to slow down for the industry writ large. Tell me a little bit more about what that might look like if you think that might even come to fruition at all. What do you think the longer-term picture for the industry looks like?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, I think, I think the growth, you know, by definition has to slow, but, you know, the question is really by how much, you know, and, and you know, how, how many years do we have left while it's still high growth? I.e.; more than kind of 30 plus percent a year. And I would think we've got probably, you know, at least a decade plus, possibly more. You know, not every state has regulated sports betting. Very few states have regulated online casino. And frankly, you know, it's just like a land-based, casino. You know, if you look at the size of the slots and you look at the size of the sports book, there'll be about, you know, 10 times as much space given to the slots. And that's because that's where the money is at. Sports betting is actually kind of a low-margin business. And, and in many, you know, a lot of people in the industry look at it as kind of, a player acquisition tool. It's a way to get someone through the door and then hopefully they stop and play some blackjack or, you know, some slots, which is a, a product in the casino which is a higher margin product. So I think, you know, you've got an enormous amount of regulatory progress left to be made, which, which I think will be made. online casino is a little bit of a tougher sell for some of these legislatures as you can imagine, but it wasn't so long ago that sports betting was inconceivable in, in so many of these states. So, you know, the, there's a kind of 50 plus 60 70 years plus, timeline of, increasingly regulating gambling in the United States and, and online is just kind of the latest, manifestation of that. So, we don't think there's any lack of, of momentum in, in the regulatory, from the regulatory standpoint. And as we, you know, get through the next couple of years, you'll get a couple of online casino states a couple more. And that will really seriously move the needle in addition to some more sports betting states, but even the existing states will grow. You know, there's, there's this kind of surge of interest when the state launches because you have all this pent-up demand which comes to market, and then things settle down. and, but once they settle down, then they grow consistently, you know, for, for, you know, probably 10 plus years. And that gives, you know, you look at the New Jersey numbers, they've had, you know, they've been doing this kind of longer than anyone and the numbers are, are fantastic and still growing. So, you know, it's, it's, and, and to very briefly touch on, you know, all things not North America, you know, this is a global industry, there's a lot of money being made around the world in this industry and it's not just English speaking markets, like, you know, the US, Canada, UK, and Ireland, you know, you've got Japan, which is probably gonna come online in the next, you know, a couple of years in a, in a legal way. You've got Brazil, which is regulating, you know, there's, there's a lot of, you know, practically every market in Europe is, is still growing, and, and, you know, profitable and, and, and very nice business for the online gambling operators.

I am your host Kinsey Grant. I'm so excited to bring you today's show, which is all about space and space technology. We have a great conversation lined up and I'm super excited to jump right into it. Before we do, a quick note: today's show is brought to you by Sidus Space. They provide space-as-a-service products for the space economy. Welcome to today's guest, Jamie Adams, Chief Technology Officer at Sidus Space. Jamie, welcome to Public Live.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJamie Adams: \u003c/strong\u003eThanks very much, Kinsey. Great to be here and look forward to our conversation today.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eI think a lot of the people who are listening to this conversation probably have had space on the brain for a couple of reasons. Recently, a failed launch from SpaceX was in the headines and since then it seems like the space industry has really re-entered the conversation as investors. Jamie, I want to start with a specific question. As we mentioned at the top here, you offer space-as-a-service as a company. Tell me a little bit more about what that means?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJamie Adams: \u003c/strong\u003eSpace-as-a-service in relation to the work that we're doing at Sidus Space includes building satellites as well as, providing the satellite data, imagery, and a lot more. Our goal is to reduce the cost timeline and operational barriers to space access, making it easier for these projects to be more affordable for organizations, individuals and government agencies to access space. We also make space data [captured via satellite technology] more affordable. We do it through an end-to-end solution. We've got a unique ability to support the full spectrum of satellite development and operations throughout. We also provide space-based aid for numerous industries, including maritime industry, agriculture, mining, forestry, oil and gas production. You name it, there are applications for Earth observation data. Our focus is on providing valuable data and services that serve those diverse sectors. We design our satellites in-house. So that makes us flexible with respect to being able to accommodate customers and needs of users as they emerge, and then also evolve it as the technology evolves. We can incorporate those new sensors and new technologies more rapidly instead of having a stagnant profile of satellites that are working.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eYou mention the goal, or at least part of the goal for Sidus Space is to reduce costs, reduce operational barriers and cost. When it comes to an industry like space, it's an expensive business to be in, so there are a ton of operational barriers there. I'm curious about how this idea of standardization might come into play in your effort to reduce the costs and operational barriers for space or space-based companies. Tell me a little bit about standardization as it factors into your business.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJamie Adams: \u003c/strong\u003eIt's a great question. There's really no standard operating system or standard approach to developing satellites. So, we're not required to follow particular standards. But we do and have adopted the NASA standards to apply to our satellite development, and what that does for us, working with NASA and DOD, is it allows us to adopt some of the best practices that come out of what there have developed over the course of many years of experience. For example, we use the NASA corps flight software on our satellite, and one of the things that it does is it creates an open interface and open-source solution to consumers who can more readily adopt. It is a little bit easier to adopt and incorporate into the overall architecture so that when consumers come to the table, they have something that they can readily adapt to. We also apply the standards that we have with respect to our ITU filings and the overall adoption of best practices that facilitate working with industry and using terminology that they readily understand. The other thing is for us as a company is that we've been in the business of manufacturing space components for every large program all the way back to the space shuttle. So we've been in the industry for quite a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eI'm curious about how the technology or the services that you're providing might differ based on whether the client or the partner is a government entity, a private company, or an international one. How does that impact the services and the technology that you provide? Yeah, so that's a great question. So one of the things that we do that is,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJamie Adams: \u003c/strong\u003eThere are various applications that we comply with. So the NASA standards, the S9100, all those things, the adoption of those things, puts us in a very good position to be able to be adaptable, but on the other side, we can customize to user solutions. So, we don't have to offer that to commercial customers that want a little bit more flexibility with respect to getting their hardware into space. The other end of that spectrum is when you are trying to work with government customers, whether it's the U.S. government or international governments, having that understanding and developing that capability to comply with those already. We've been able to adopt both industry standard and government standards with varying degrees of flexibility.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eA lot of what we've talked about so far in this conversation has dealt largely with the big picture, these kinds of broader industry contours. I would love to talk a little more specifically about satellites and about satellite tech. Can you tell me a little bit about what you're most excited about in terms of the satellites and the satellite tech that you guys are developing?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJamie Adams: \u003c/strong\u003eWe are primarily building Earth observation satellites. So there's a couple of different kinds of satellites, communications, Earth observations, there's applications across the, across the board. In the Earth observation spectrum, there's also a ton of components within that, for example, you can do maritime vessel tracking. So, you put an Autonomous Information System, which is essentially collecting beacon data from transmitters on all maritime vessels. And you pull that data up to the satellite and give a very broad range of coverage that the end consumer wants to tie into. You can couple that with imagery sensors and infuse that data together. In some cases there, there's a market for collecting that shipping data, the vessel data where it is, and then providing that to an end consumer. In other cases, if you couple that with imagery, you create another layer of data that is tremendously valuable to the end consumer. So, there's a somewhat limitless amount of market available for the Earth observation satellites. And that's where we're focused: using that data, and those processing systems for the imagery to get near real-time space data and get that to our customers. It's about actionable intelligence for their end use.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eI think this brings to mind an important part of the space conversation. When we talk more specifically about technology and its applications, what are the timelines, like for new projects, as as they come about? Is there a way to predict when the technology might actually be utilized or put into use?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJamie Adams: \u003c/strong\u003eIt can be a little bit unpredictable. There's a lot of things that are out of our control, and we try to do as much as we can for things outside of our control, like the supply chain. That's a big one. One of the things that we do to make our satellites more flexible and keep the cost down is reuse of commercial off the shelf (COTS) solutions. It's a big component of what we do. We essentially scour the globe for suppliers to support those efforts. And so that supply chain then is always a factor in the logistics for getting launches in place, whether the weather is going to play a factor, other factors governmentally and things that are going on in the globe, those are all things that can drive our schedules in and in our timelines. We are very focused on making sure that we have a robust level of suppliers, not only have options and backups, but also have great relationships that we've developed with those suppliers to make sure that we can meet our customer timelines. One of our key discriminators for us is trying to accelerate those timelines, with very little notice. We typically say we can get you into space within 12 months, from the time that we get on contract to the time that we actually fly. And we get our payloads in hand and in roughly in the six-month timeframe. But we've got some flexibility within that based on the way we have worked our timelines and our suppliers. It's an ongoing thing that you have to do constantly, revisit that, look for other suppliers. And then the other piece of it is how do we infuse new technologies and putting those on our tech roadmap to bring them in so that we're always kind of tip of the spear with respect to what's out there and what's available to bring into, into our architecture.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eJamie, I'm curious about how you measure the success of a mission. And you know, we asked this, obviously, in the weeks following this starship explosion, that still has been determined to be successful, to some degree. You learn a lesson when something explodes, especially when we're talking about some of the most powerful rockets ever created. But I'm curious about how you as scientists might measure success.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJamie Adams: \u003c/strong\u003eFrom our perspective, trying to measure success can vary from mission to mission. In some cases, if we get to orbit, we're able to establish baseline communications and get core systems up and running. Especially for our initial missions, that is a measure of success. And you mentioned SpaceX and it's an interesting paradigm, because Elon Musk came out and talked about what they thought they could do in that mission, and what they were expecting, and calibrating expectations. So that's another component of it is to calibrate, and set the expectations so that people understand the degree of success, because sometimes, especially based on the fact that we are a space-as-a-service company, sometimes what we're trying to put in space, and and operate for a customer is very unique, and very specific to that particular mission. The degree of success may come within a few weeks, it may come within a few months, or it may take a few years. There are variables. From one to another, we are focused on defining our success criteria. What's the minimum viable product that we come down with, with respect to results? Currently we're focused on Leo, we're looking at, you know, beyond that, but when you're looking at each one of those things into that equation, there are varying degrees of success with respect to the stepping stones to achieve one of those objectives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eTo close out here and finish up this conversation. Jamie, I would love to talk a little bit about some of the broader industry trends that the people who are listening to this might be most interested in understanding a little bit better. So for anybody who might be interested in the business of space, what would you say are some of the big picture industry trends that you're tracking most right now?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJamie Adams: \u003c/strong\u003eAI, compute at the edge, fusion of data, so the quicker that we can incorporate artificial intelligence on the satellite, and take the Earth observation imagery, fuse that together, make the data usable as it is passed down from the satellite so that almost instant gratification perspective of I'm a consumer of the data, how quickly am I going to have my data in hand? How can I use that to drive my market? That's a key component. So anything that you can do to enhance that ability. One of the things that Sidus Space has done is we've employed a significant and diverse portfolio of ground station providers so that the latency of the data coming down to the ground is relatively short. And then when you combine that with compute at the edge, things that we're doing on orbit and bringing that data down. Sometimes customers just want the raw data, but they want it very quickly. So in that case, having the robust support of ground stations where we're going to pass those in a very rapid manner that gets the raw data down to fuse data, data at the edge, AI, you know, those those kind of things that we're going to continue to evolve and put intelligence to that data so that the end user can make quicker decisions about what they're going to apply it to. Those are the keys for keeping ahead of this market, and making sure that our customers are getting what they're looking for. And that could also be the same thing with payloads that we're flying. Their ability to exercise their payload, have it operate in space, and immediately take that data and take it out to their customer base or their development timelines. Because a lot of these people, it's a race to get their technology developed, get it proven in space against their competitors. We have an ability to help them accelerate that pace of where they're actually going to be able to fly their technology and get their data down to the ground in a usable manner where they can make key performance decisions. And that globally applies to any of our customers on the back end.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eThank you, Jamie. I think this is a fantastic way to finish out this conversation with some of these forward looking ideas. And I really appreciate your time. It's been so wonderful to hear more about your perspective and to hear more about scientists. So thank you so much, Jamie.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJamie Adams: \u003c/strong\u003eKinsey, thank you and appreciate everybody tuning in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eI want to thank Jamie Adams, Chief Technology Officer at Sidus Space for his time today.

I'm your host Kinsey Grant. Today's show is brought to you by SinglePoint, a renewable energy and sustainable lifestyle company. And I'm so excited to welcome our guests, which I will do in just a minute, to give you a quick heads up on what we're gonna be talking about today. We have some major big time investing themes coming at you in today's edition of the Public Podcast. We're talking solar as a category within the renewable sector, which is obviously very interesting to, I'm sure, tons of you who are listening to this right now. We're gonna be talking about what solar means for the broader renewable sector, about some of the companies that make up the solar value chain. We're gonna be talking about the Inflation Reduction Act. And of course, throughout all of this, the ways that you as investors can potentially add this theme to your portfolio and hopefully learn a lot. So to do all of that, I'm super excited to welcome our wonderful guest today. Rene Reyna, the Head of Thematic ETF Product Strategy at Invesco. Rene, welcome to Public Live.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRene Reyna:\u003c/strong\u003e Hi Kinsey, great to be here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, super excited to jump in today. We have, like I mentioned, a lot to cover. So if you're ready, we'll get right into it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRene Reyna: \u003c/strong\u003eWorks for me. I'm excited.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eAll right, me too, me too. Okay, so Rene, I wanna start here with kind of the big picture. We are definitely going to get into the Inflation Reduction Act stuff, which has obviously been a huge moment for renewables as a sector. We'll get to that during this conversation, but before we get there, I would love to talk about solar as it fits into renewables as a broader sector in investing in the economy. Tell me a little bit about how solar is tracking within the renewable sector right now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRene Reyna: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, sure. So, you know, if it's okay, maybe just take a step back and, you know, just think of renewables or clean energy in the sense of this energy transition that's taking place. And so, you know, I think we all recognize what are the drivers there. So one, you got climate change. You know, the science does demonstrate that the burning of fossil fuel does have a major impact to the air we breathe, right? And so there's the negative impacts associated with the environment. There's negative impacts associated with human health. And then there's the economic impacts that are also a result of some of this climate change. So I think of clean energy, renewable sort of along the sustainability sort of opportunity set, if you will. I think secondly, there's energy security we need to think about. So, you know, the less reliance we have on energy imports, you know, think of the power OPEC has and how that impacts the average consumer, you know, I think renewables can help solve for that. And then there's economic benefits. I mean, if we think about job creation as a result of some of these new transitions that are taking place, the new technology, if you will, and then also the lower energy costs as we create more scale along some of the renewable sources. So it really is exciting what's taking place, renewables. If I look at solar specifically, you know, it's just one important part of the sort of renewable puzzle. And so I think of solar in the context of what are the other renewable energy sources. So, generally speaking, you think about wind, you think about hydro, you think about biomass, and geothermal, and collectively renewables are surpassing US electric generation. For example, we passed nuclear in 2021, we passed coal-fired generation in 2022. So renewables are really having a meaningful impact. The US renewables represent 21, 22% of US electricity generation. Solar is about 3.5% of that, which goes to the question. So solar, as a part of this renewable puzzle, if you will, it is a, it's unique and it's very important. It's widely available, easy to deploy. So we think about the sun as a resource. Clearly, it's a resource that we have available day in and day out. It could be easily installed, so it's flexible. So think about installing rooftops, large solar farms, as an example. I think what's unique about solar, from an investment perspective, is cost. And so if we think about from 2010 to about 2020, we've seen costs of solar installs come down. Now, it hasn't been just a straight line downward. We've seen some pressures and increase in costs the last couple of years. But that in itself, if you think about some of the trade-offs, we go back to early 2000s, a lot of consumers, for example, were not doing the math and saying, hey, what is the breakeven if I want to install a solar panel in my home? And generally, it was about 20 years. And then you fast forward to today, and that breakeven. In a single digit of years. And again, there's a lot of other factors that can go into that. But clearly there's been a lot of advancements. So I think that makes soil unique. The economic benefits and job creation, which I mentioned earlier, if we think about solar jobs in comparison to oil extraction, coal mining, there's actually more US jobs in solar production than there are in those two categories, which I don't think many people realize. So there is this economic benefit. And sort of the last component I think about solar, and I know this is a long answer, so I apologize, but the innovation, the technology around solar. If I think of the solar plus storage, for example, Renova, which is one of the holdings in one of our ETFs, partners with Tesla's Powerwall for installs. The solar battery storage went from saving approximately six minutes worth of energy up to about 10 hours plus today. And so those are some of the factors that I think make solar exciting if I think about renewable energy more broadly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's a phenomenal way to get started with this conversation. I think that established a ton of the important context that we need to understand why solar and renewables, more broadly speaking, have become a theme that investors might be gravitating toward. And later in the conversation, I do want to make sure we hit on that element of how investors might be able to add solar as a theme to their investing portfolio and to their investing strategy. But even before we get there. I would love to dig in a little bit more to the nitty gritty of the renewable sector, particularly solar. When we're talking about the energy value chain, the solar energy value chain, I'm curious about what has made it such that those prices have come down. We're talking obviously about a lot of different moving parts and elements that come together to create solar as a part of the renewable sector. But I'm curious to hear a little bit more about the industries or the sub-industries that might be contributing to this wider proliferation of solar energy as part of the renewables landscape. What are those elements that are coming together to make solar a more affordable or more accessible option right now?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRene Reyna:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, so I think in the general sense, or in these terms, is increased utilization, increased technology. And that scalability has helped bring down costs if I think of the solar value chain Specifically, so you know generally the components are you have sort of the production side insulation side you have financing then you have kind of ongoing maintenance and When you think of it from you know, just breaking down some of these segments. So the first component is upstream, so think polysilicon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant:\u003c/strong\u003e Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRene Reyna:\u003c/strong\u003e You know, DocuNew Energy and GCL Technologies, who are the largest players in this space, those polysilicon costs have come down quite a bit. And these materials are used for kind of that midstream area where we think about solar panel manufacturers. So, you know, solar panels are made up of PV cells. They convert sunlight into electricity. So you have solar wafers, solar cells, and solar modules. The companies that played this there would be like Cinco Solar Canadian solar United renewables These are sort of your midstream players. This also includes inverter Manufacture so you have to at some point convert your son into your DC to AC back to DC and so these inverters are Inverse using manufacturers. So think of like the end phases of the world solar edge. These would be considered kind of that midstream category. And then from there, you kind of go downstream. So now start thinking about installers, distributors, some of the utility companies. And Cavus is a big solar utility company. No far energy, if I think about like installations and building out of some of these solar farms, they're a big company in this space. So globally, this sets up sort of this value chain. And so as more commitments to increasing solar utilization, increasing capacity, that has over time driven down cost. When we look at sort of the space and say, well, who are some of the bigger suppliers that are helping, you know, reduce some of these costs? You know, China is the biggest manufacturer when it comes to solar manufacturing, solar parts. And so it's really some of their scale. We looked at China economically a lot for lower manufacturing costs. But collectively, that has brought down some of the costs. And so demand is growing not only in China, it's growing in Europe, it's growing in the US. So all these countries and corporations, for that matter, who are making commitments to reduce their carbon emissions, is all contributing to the scale and that's ultimately bringing down some of those costs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, certainly, it certainly makes a lot of sense. And I think this idea of the way that renewables are scaling and solar specifically are scaling right now certainly makes a compelling case for why this cost might be decreasing. This utilization has really picked up and we have reason to believe that it might continue to pick up because of news that has come from DC, from certain industry, but very much DC over the last year or so. I think this is a great segue to talk about the Inflation Reduction Act, which was passed last year, made some pretty landmark provisions for clean energy. I would love to hear your perspective on how the Inflation Reduction Act, commonly referred to as the IRA, how that might've impacted solar. Tell me a little bit more about what the impact has been from that legislation on the solar space. So, I'm gonna go ahead and start with the solar. So, I'm gonna start with the solar.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRene Reyna: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so it was huge, in my opinion. You know, I think it just speaks to our commitment, which globally, I think there was some concern. So, you know, not to get into the politics of it, but, you know, it's kind of goes to the timeline. You know, there was a transition from President Trump to President Biden. You know, almost immediately he rejoins the Paris Accord. And so this is sort of the global commitment to reduce, you know, carbon emissions. And then he also had his legislation that ultimately got passed, the Inflation Reduction Act, and it resulted in the largest climate-related bill ever. So $369 billion in spending and green energy tax credits were a result of the IRA. And so in some cases, it extended some tax credits that are already exist. Some listeners maybe heard of the Energy Policy Act that was created back in 2005. And so there were already some subsidies or tax credits that were in place that were sort of being reduced over time. And so this sort of reignited those tax credits, extended them for another 10 years, increased some of those tax credits up to 30%. And so this really helps stimulate this marketplace. And so if I think some of the impact of the IRA specifically, you heard me talk a lot about reducing carbon emissions. So I think this sort of fast tracks the US a little bit. There are various studies out there. I think some of what I read was perhaps it increases our speed by 40 percent in terms of hitting some of these targets by 2030. So I think that was impactful. I think also there were parts of the IRA that included tax credits for production. So there's been a lot of talk, I think we've heard in the news, around on-shoring, so reducing our reliance on other countries and their production. So there was a lot of supply chain issues, for example, that delayed and increased costs recently. And so these new incentives should and actually are enticing companies to produce and manufacture here in the US. So again, I talked about some of the economic benefits around job creation. So that's a positive. And we've seen some of the largest manufacturers. So First Solar, A Solar, you know, they've all committed already to manufacture here in the US. So, you know, this should serve as a stimulus really to this transition. Now again, I think we have to acknowledge the environment we're in today. You know, we have a high inflation and interest rate environment. So we are seeing a little bit of maybe not the quick acceleration that we would like. And I think a lot of it is because now you have consumers, businesses have to make decisions around investments due to the inflation and trade environment. But nonetheless, over the long term, this is viewed as net positive. And I think the one thing I'll say too, and I hope, I just want to emphasize that, because the costs have come down so significantly, because corporations and countries are committing to reducing their carbon emissions, I look at some of these subsidies and incentives as really icing on the cake. And so in other words, I think we were kind of going down this path already, and now you have some, let's call it longer commitments in terms of the US with these tax credits that should help maybe move some of those that were on the fence a little bit about making that commitment, sort of bring them over the line, if you will. So I think it's really exciting and we should see increased solar production as well as solar utilization here in the US over the next few years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's a great kind of big picture, 30,000 foot view of what's going on in solar. And it's certainly helpful to hear the context in the background around how this very much talked about legislation is actually going to come to fruition with the economic realities that we're all facing today. So now that we have gotten that big picture, that kind of zoom out view of what's going on in solar, I would love to talk a little bit about the more micro, how can investors who are listening to this, include solar in their portfolios as a theme, knowing what we know now about the impacts of the global value chain of the Inflation Reduction Act, of all of these big picture ideas we've talked about. How can investors approach potentially adding solar into their strategy?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRene Reyna\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I guess there's a lot of couple of ways, right? So hopefully you've heard over my comments. I talked about some of the value chain, if you will. So certainly there's ways to sort of handpick companies, if you're an integral stock buyer, to try and pick and choose those that you think could participate in this theme. I think there's some maybe more efficient ways. The ETF market allows you really to capture a theme. We here at Invesco actually have the industry's first and largest solar ETF. The ticker on that is $TAN. And really the approach of this fund, so it's a passive strategy, it's rules-based. We basically are tracking the max solar index. And what this index is comprised of is all the companies that sort of represent the solar value chain. And so what the methodology or the index does is it screens for companies that either will be considered a pure play, so two-thirds or more of their revenue is coming from the solar theme, and those would get sort of like a 1.0-factor weighting, if you will. And then companies that we consider medium plays. These are companies that have at least a third. And up to two-thirds of the revenue coming from the Solar theme. They'll get sort of a half of their weighting. And this then index sort of creates a list of companies. Currently, there are 44. It's a modified market cap. So it'll set limits on how much a company can represent in the portfolio. So the limit today is 10%. And then what happens is every quarter that those rules are reapplied and rebalanced on a quarterly basis. So you're ensuring you're maintaining ownership of these pure plays. I think an interesting thing as well as about this ETF, the solar landscape is global. So I mentioned China is a leader. We're seeing growth in Europe. And so you are going to have global representation in this US, which is important if you really want to capture the theme. So today, it's about 35% US exposure, 15% is coming from China, 12% is real. Then you have some smaller ones. You have some Germany holdings, Hong Kong. So it really gives you sort of that broad exposure to the theme. And it's just a convenient way in one ticker to get exposure. The fund is currently about two billion in size. So I mentioned it's one of the largest and it's got a cool ticker too, I mean, T-A-N, tan, easy to remember, think of the sun. And so it's been an easy way for investors to get pure-play exposure to this theme.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, certainly tan during the summertime. How could you forget it? So simple. All right, so Renee, this has been such a wonderful conversation. I really appreciate all of your incredible context and analysis, and insight. Feel like I've really learned a ton about this space right now. That has certainly gotten a lot of interest over the last several months and years.

I'm your host Annika Lewis. Today we're joined by Pooja Rajan, founder of Etherworld and Ethereum community builder who will help us break down the game changing Ethereum upgrade that just happened, which has sparked a rally for the world's second largest cryptocurrency. Pooja, thank you so much for being here.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThank you. I'm so excited to be back here.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, very big week. Lots of news to discuss. So plenty to cover today.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eFirst off, can you tell us a little bit about what just happened? So what was the Shapella upgrade? The combination of the Shanghai and Cappella upgrades – what does it accomplish? And why is it such a big milestone for Ethereum?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, of course. So Shapella, as you have beautifully explained, is a combination of Shanghai and Capella. So Shanghai executed four core EIPs on the main net, whereas Capella brought some specific changes on the consensus layer. So these four EIPs were \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eEIP-4895, 3651, 3855, and 3860.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe rest\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e three EIDs, which starts from three, most of them are for EVM upgrades, EVM changes, and there was this 36511 coin base, which was a tool to make gas cheaply, cheaper for contract developers, however, EIP 4895, introduced a system level operation to support validator withdrawals. Withdrawals were the key change for this particular upgrade. So many people may know that Ethereum moved into proof of stake back in 2022 with the merge, but the proof of stake work on the chain started back in 2020 with the release of Beacon chain.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe shift towards POS already happened in the past two upgrades. However, it closed the loop with the Shapella upgrade. So in 2020 when it was introduced it was unidirectional; people can only add ETH, become a validator and have their reward in the wallet but that was not realized. Shapella upgrade enabled accessing those rewards and validators can now go in and come out freely. If they want to stay they can come out with partial withdrawals and if they want to completely exit they can come up with the full withdrawal. So that's what the Shapella upgrade brought to the Ethereum Network.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAwesome. Thank you for the overview. And I would love to focus a little bit on withdrawals because they were one of the big headlines of this upgrade from what you just shared. And, of course, there were worries, folks had of initial rapid outflows after the upgrade. But just .3% of all 18.1 million tokens staked were actually withdrawn in the 12 hours after the upgrade based on data from Nansen. And so tell us a little bit about your perspective on withdrawals. Are you surprised at the low withdrawal rate? Why do you think stakers are keeping their Ethereum? What do you take away from all this?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThere are a couple of things about it. I think that can be my perspective, which I would like to share with you. First of all, like, when people were trying to activate withdrawal, there was this validator credential change that has to happen before they can enable their withdrawal. So far, only 72 people validated credential has been updated, right at that time, when withdrawal, when this upgrade happened 40,000 credential changes took place. So that is the first thing, the first blocker for validators to withdraw because they have to first be able to change their credential. A message was signed, and many of the validators have already done it, but some of them are still in process. That's part one.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe other two parts are that the Ethereum chain has a churn limit like not everybody can withdraw their money at one point of time, at the same time. So they have to go through a process cue, there are certain limits for the partial withdrawal per day. Similarly, there are certain limits for full withdrawal per day, we try to maintain this protocol there. So we do not put the security of network for a concern at any point of time. There should be a good flow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo that's there for the second thing. And the most important thing, which I think is with this Shapella upgrade, obviously many validators were able to take out their XX the reward that they have earned over a period of time. And this gives confidence to many others who were planning to take out their money, or were planning to get into the system. So I think the Shapella upgrade gives a lot of confidence to existing and new validators to continue doing their duties as a validator on the network.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAwesome, appreciate that rundown. Talking a little bit more about just kind of the withdrawal risk and helping people understand the theory and how it works. So, about 16% of all the ether supply has been locked up in the protocol for staking as of earlier this month, you talked earlier about the Ethereum chain having a turn limit and not everyone being able to withdraw at once. So, what would happen in theory, if stakers decided to withdraw a lot in a large portion of that?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLarge portion here can be the maximum that they have earned plus the deposit that they have made on the network. I think the average is somewhere around 34 ETH per validator on the network as of now. So, if again, the validator decided to take out all that means they are making full withdrawal at any particular time that they are willing to make that withdrawal and they are signaling about it. With the process of withdrawal there is another process going on in parallel is becoming a validator. If we take a look at the chart like I had data for the month of February, we have a good amount of validators also getting in.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo, with that churn limit, we definitely do not see the network in threat at any point because they would not allow too many validators to come out of the chain at any single day. And at the same time, there are validators who are also getting into staking as I mentioned. I am taking a look at the dashboard by Metrica which is supported by Ethereum. So, if we can take a look here, you can see that as validators are coming out, they are also getting in so security is there. The loop is closed, which means the function is working properly. So I think people will be getting confident only instead of losing that and when they decide to come out you know, they also have limited options.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhat they can do with the Eth they want to take out either they can trade it to you know, get into some other cryptocurrency or in cash that or they can keep it in their own wallet like E-wallet but there's no point keeping it with them in their wallet and not doing anything with that. There is another option that is coming up is like staking with the help of a liquid staking pool. That's another option. But again, with a liquid staking pool, people will also come as validators into the system. So yeah, I don't see a threat yet. Obviously there, there's a lot of confidence getting in.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight. And for those on the call, who are perhaps less familiar with Ethereum and ETH staking, can you talk a little bit about what the incentives are for people to keep their Ether staked even now that the Shapella upgrade is complete?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo, the minimum requirement is if you want to become a solo staker, of course, the minimum requirement is 30 ETH that you have to deposit on the network. However, if you do not have the study of ETH, there are multiple options available in the ecosystem. You can go with as I mentioned, like the liquid staking pools. So, for becoming a solo staker also, you need to have a set of, you know, technical help also to run both nodes execution node and consensus node on your own like on your on your home or wherever you want to do that and make sure that they are online at all points of the network.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHowever, if you are not technically skilled enough to participate in the network as a solo staker, you can definitely take advantage of the staking services provided there are different kinds of staking services liquid staking is quite popular, because that also gives you the advantage of making use of the Eth while you have already staked like there are like they provide a token that pool token that you can be using in place of ETH. So there are other services, I think going with the services is a good way to get involved and make money. But if you want to make a real contribution and want to learn the network more, it would be a good idea to do solo staking. There are 10 clients available, five on the execution side and five on the consensus side. And they all have discord channels, they are willing to provide all kinds of support. So that's always less risky. But yeah, there are multiple options people can use.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGot it. And do you anticipate the unlocking of staked Ether and the rewards that will be paid out is going to attract intensified regulatory pressure from the SEC or how do you think about that and the change that just happened?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u0026nbsp; We are aware Kraken and Coinbase are definitely having some regulatory pressure right over there. But I am not sure if that's because of the unlocking of ETH that could be with their process like the way they would like to operate in the United States. This depends on the government. But I highly doubt that locking unlocking will in any way affect the government policy over here because locking unlocking is an individual's choice and if they are participating in a blockchain that depends on the government of that location where he or she is living, right? So I don't think they’re interrelated. That's what I meant to say here.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah. All right. So zooming out a little bit, just into kind of Ethereum’s journey more broadly. How does this upgrade position Ethereum for more long term success and mainstream adoption?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight. So, as I was mentioning, like Ethereum, proof of stake was kind of a dream for Ethereum people who started them back in 2015. They always wanted to have proof of stake. It took time like it took a lot of years to be here. Finally, we are having a full cycle of Ethereum validators here. I think now we have a complete system built up. Now what we need to do is improve the present system. We need to improve the present blockchain and that's what is our next priority.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo the next upgrade that we are hoping to have would be based on scaling obviously, the proposal, inactive discussion and maybe ready for dev nets as well is EIP 4844. That will help layer two projects to maybe interact with the chain and be able to scale Ethereum transactions as well. So that's next.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd I think there could be few other improvements to be done. We would probably propose builder separation to try to make it more decentralized to the set of validators, proposers, relayers so we can make sure that security is never at threat. But if we talk about a system and ecosystem that can be, you know, running in parallel or the present ecosystem, Ethereum blockchain has already provided that with the Shapella upgrade.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight. And zooming out a little bit more to kind of more of the mainstream adoption piece, do you believe that Ethereum will eventually surpass Bitcoin as the most dominant cryptocurrency and what do you think is still left? What would it take for that to happen?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSurpassing Bitcoin – that's an interesting question. I would like to share my take on that. So I believe that Bitcoin is the number one currency because of its total market price like shares that it contains, as well as the value that it has, right? But if you look at the user, you would see Etherum\u0026nbsp; has more distributed users. Multiple projects are running on top of Ethereum blockchain. Projects are trying to interact with Ethereum Blockchain. So I'm definitely confident here that Ethereum may, in the long run, be ahead of Bitcoin definitely in terms of user base.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePrice wise, it's hard to predict because a lot of things are associated with it. Ethereum transactions require gas, we are trying to figure it out and gas is again, the ETH there. So a lot of things to be taken care of. I am not in a position to talk about the price. But from users perspective and mainstream adoption. I think it's already ahead in the race.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, awesome. All right. Well, before we wrap up Pooja, anything else you'd like to share or anything else we should be aware of coming up for the Ethereum community?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjan: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI would say that people need to be here, if we want this to be the most decentralized network. Ethereum has a good user base, but this contributor base can never be enough. We want the mainstream people to join us and for that they have to join and make the contribution in the way they can make. There are multiple opportunities Ethereum protocol gets into a lot of research – there are a lot of research findings going on.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIf you would like to learn more about Ethereum, pick up the topics that people are working on. Join us as an intern. Ethereum also has this EPF - Ethereum Protocol Fellowship program, join those programs if you are a developer, if you are a researcher or a PhD institution, reach out to contribute your research work. There's a lot of opportunity to get involved. Obviously, you can make money by becoming validated and earning rewards as well. And trading is another thing, but you become a part of the network, by your way, the way you like.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo, look forward to what we are doing here. There's lots of new changes coming up as I was mentioning about 4844. Account abstraction is already out there EIP 4337 so wallet and these types of smart contract developers can start taking a look at this proposal and may implement it in their projects. There are a lot of opportunities out there. Stay tuned. All the best to everyone. I hope Ethereum will become a big success with the help of you all.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAwesome. Thank you Pooja and before we drop, if folks want to follow you, where can they follow you to hear more about what you're talking about with respect to Ethereum? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjam: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAs I mentioned, I'm a part of Ethereum Cat Herders. So ETH Cat Herders discord is one of the best places where people can come and chime in and share their questions, comments, concerns related to Ethereum blockchain or Ethereum protocol. I'm also available on Twitter at poojaranjan19, so you can follow me on most of the social media Twitter, Telegram and all so yeah, I'm available there as well.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnika Lewis: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAwesome - well thank you so much for being here and for talking about this very important upgrade with all of us. I know I learned a lot and I'm sure everybody else did too. Once again, this was Pooja Ranjan and founder of Etherworld and Ethereum community builder. Thanks, everyone. Have a great weekend and we'll be back with you soon.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePooja Ranjam: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThank you so much.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","eventType":"PUBLIC_LIVE","assetCategorization":["CRYPTO"],"sponsorDetailsDto":null,"audienceCohort":"ALL_MEMBERS","hosts":[{"publicId":"b2efbdf4-9140-445d-b0fe-a0e7210cbfd8","username":"PoojaRanjan","displayName":"Pooja Ranjan","profilePictureURL":"https://prod-api.154310543964.hellopublic.com/static/users/images/QHhgM2EBnFOgdZad8F2gM6b9eGKl1PD5-thumbnail-300x300.jpg","verified":false,"isPrivate":false,"bio":"Herder-in-chief @ EthCatHerders | Founder @ ether_world | Co-founder @ blockaction_io | Alumni @ Accenture","followedByMe":false,"following":false},{"publicId":"e7aec298-af79-4394-b541-fab46c1d8361","username":"AnnikaLewis","displayName":"Annika Lewis","profilePictureURL":"https://prod-api.154310543964.hellopublic.com/static/users/images/WwsSl0psufF8zoEDBpp4Au9xnvFaqXOW-thumbnail-300x300.jpg","verified":true,"isPrivate":false,"bio":"All things Web3, data, and Canada.

We're going to be covering lots of things from The possible TikTok ban and its potential impact. With us today, once again is Mark Mahaney, senior managing director and head of the internet research team over at Evercore ISI. He is also the author of a new book titled Nothing But Net 10 timeless stop picking lessons from one of Wall Street's top tech analysts and we are doing a book giveaway. So if you want to get your hands on a copy, just send a DM to the public live handle. You see it right there on the top of your screen, folks. All right, it's time to get into it. Hi, Mark. Welcome back to public life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Hey, Kori. Good. Hey, good to hear you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, it's good to hear you too. A lot of change actually Mark since I last talked to you. I don't know if you're aware a lot in the financial industry has changed. But today we're gonna focus on the tech stuff and what's happening with TikTok, I mean, the company's CEO, he provided that testimony. He was on Capitol Hill this morning, where he really received some tough, tough criticism with one lawmaker even stating, and I quote, I expect today, you'll say anything to avoid this outcome, but we are not buying it. What were your takeaways from the TikTok CEOs testimony?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e I hope that none of my children ever have to go on the Capitol Hill and testify with the weekend that he had, I wouldn't wish that fate on my greatest enemy. So I'm sorry to carry on being kind of glib about it. But that was, you know, I respect him. And I respect him for going up there and taking that, it's kind of like Zuckerberg, you know, in the last year or two or two years ago, being brought up to Capitol Hill to testify. It's kind of like the leaders of tech being brought up there Bezos and, and Tim Cook, etc, are being brought up to testify that was just unfortunately for TikTok, they're going up against two major issues, social health concerns, related to social media usage. And then much more importantly, these days is national security issues. And so, you know, you knew that the question was just how much defense he could play in that time, and I didn't watchall of the testimony. But that's what I was just struck by and I think maybe more importantly, just today's testimony, the action question for all of us as public market investors because we can't invest in TikTok or, or at least not as a separate standalone asset. I don't think we'll ever see it that way, is what are the implications of this for other social media assets, specifically, Snap, Meta, and Google? And I think the probability of TikTok getting banned in the US is just increasing, you know, relatively materially over the last 12 months. I know there are a lot of constitutional issues around this. And I think they're very serious. But I just think that the odds of some sort of ban or major restriction have increased materially. And so that's kind of a pending catalyst. And anytime the news flow comes up, you'll see names like Snap and Meta outperform on that day, which is what you're seeing today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e You know, I feel what I'm hacking a little bit more in terms of the broader social media context, because you did reference, you know, Zuckerberg having to go up there kind of, you know, defend all the stuff that Facebook, you know, had going on all the negative things specifically, right, that was happening. I mean, you even saw back in the day with Dorsey, he had to go there. Back when he was still leading his company. He co-founded Twitter. I mean, you see it across the board, it doesn't seem to be net like it doesn't seem to be ending anytime soon. And one of my takeaways from what happened today with TikTok, specifically, Mark is that I feel like they're also getting the brunt of all of the aforementioned right, big social media companies. It's like they've had enough time at the batting cage, right? With the Facebooks, with the Googles of the world, with the Snaps that now they're just ready to unleash completely on TikTok.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Kori, I think that's right. But no, but don't forget this. I mean, we got a major political issue, growing political tensions between the US and China. And that's what made this tougher, I think, than anything that the tech companies had to face before because, you know, they,Those are US companies, you know, presenting in front of their elected representatives. That's not the case with TikTok and at the moment when relations between the US and China are at the lowest that they've been and, you know, I'm no expert on that. But um, in some time and maybe decades, so it's just, there's just a lot of different angles here that made it much tougher for TikTok to come through and again, it's kind of hard to see a political out here because it looks to look from where I stand it, it looks like the US military has banned Tiktok from personnel devices, personal and personnel devices. You've had more states do that. You've had a federal government do that you'd like that. That's from government-owned devices. So you've already gotten pretty far down the path here. You've never had that happen with any of the other apps. So and that's not because there's a greater social health issue related to TikTok than there was to Snap or to Facebook. It's because of the Chinese national security issue. So that this is just a bigger, this is just my this is more explosive of an issue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e No, it definitely is something else that you brought up earlier is that you know, you don't think there will ever really see TikTok, as a standalone kind of investable company where people like you or myself, your company would be able to then you know, buy shares in TikTok, it is owned by ByteDance. However, are there some scenarios perhaps in your mind Mark that could play out if TikTok were forced to sell or spin on where it could become, you know, a company at some point that you are I could invest in?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well I don't think so. There was an article in the papers this morning in China that the Chinese government for the first time made an official statement that they would be strongly opposed to a forced sale of TikTok. So I mean, I'm no expert on China, I just assumed that there would be some statement that would come out along the way to this effect. Well, it's out. So I think that's why a ban is such a distinct probability, because I don't think ByteDance will be allowed, even if they wanted to, and I don't think they want to, they wouldn't be allowed to sell TikTok to a US company. So TikTok's in the middle of a geopolitical Firestorm that's, it's unfortunate for them. And you know, I give them all credit. This is a highly innovative company now, whether they actually create a national security risk, that's, you know, there are thorough, thoughtful arguments on that. But anyway, that probably matters. Neither here nor less, it doesn't matter now, Kori, we're not gonna be able to get the chance to invest. So let's focus on the companies that could be derivatives of there. That's Meta. Alphabet because of YouTube and Snap. And I really do think sometimes we spend a little too much time on Snap as a derivative. I think that the use case you know, for those who have used TikTok a lot, you think about what other assets like Snap is more of a communications tool than that kind of leaned forward entertainment tool. That TikTok is but the analogies are really, Instagram and YouTube and those would be the beneficiaries where they were TikTok to be banned.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Okay, that was a foreign mission company is like Google because of YouTube likes Facebook, obviously, also owns Instagram. This is a perfect lead into my next question, because I know over at Evercore, you guys recently hosted a panel with three experts who collectively oversee $1 billion in ad budgets, these are companies that have really been struggling right in the ad space. But the panel revealed some signs that this ad a winter it could be starting to thaw, could you provide some insight into what you're seeing in the ad space, and how we could you know, positively impact some of those other companies that we could invest in?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I think we're still in an ad winter, I think that's what we've uncovered so far with, with the channel checks that we've done, maybe that's not terribly surprising. And, you know, there's a broadening consensus that, that we do have a recession coming. So you know, we could be staying in an ad winter for quite some time. I don't think we're going to see crocus's anytime soon. I think Kori, those are the first plants that show up in the snow out of the snow, but you're also into horticulture Mark, you're a man of many talents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e And somebody can correct me on my pronunciation of crocus's. But, but, but I, I don't, I don't think we're gonna get a quick V shape recovery in marketing spend in advertising spend. And so that's going to be a bit of a drag on some of these names. The advantage and one of the reasons we like Meta frankly, one of the reasons it's our number one recommendation is you don't need to believe that to be long Meta, because they've taken so many of the costs out of their business. And then they've got this new reals, monetization, and they're doing much better targeting than they were years ago. And if you've got this new ad format called click to messaging, click the message which is used much less than the US but it's widely used outside of the US especially in areas of the world like Latin America and parts of Asia. And that's, that's a it's a brand new there's like a product cycle here. You need a product cycle because the overall market is getting soft, and it's not good. It's not firming up yet it's not getting better. And we're still in an ad winter and you know, we should probably assume we're gonna continue to be one for as it's gonna be a long winter it's gonna be several more months at least.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Mark I don't know. I remember you being this type of pessimistic in terms of the ad winter continuing and then you brought up the dreaded R word recession, goodness, a lot of things in what you just said that are very important takeaways. I'm gonna keep it moving, though, because Amazon, this is a company that has been doing a complete like 180 in terms of its firing, it's not doing the speed hiring anymore. They just announced on Monday, they're gonna lay off another 9000 employees. Do you have any thoughts on this mark?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I think the big backdrop here is actually I thought Amazon was the first of the major tech companies to acknowledge that they had over hired overbuilt during the COVID crisis, they said this on their march 22 earnings call that was the that would have been last April, so about a year ago, but then they didn't really act on it. Whereas I think Facebook didn't acknowledge it early, but then they acted on it by laying off a good number of employees. Look, these layoffs are they're no fun for anybody there painful for all people involved. I've gone through it. And, so I wish it on nobody but you know, just as consumer households have to tighten their belts when times get tough. So do corporations, and especially those that over-hired and over-extrapolated from COVID demand trends. And Amazon was one of those, you could actually look they grew their expenses faster than they grew their revenue, and their revenue grew quickly, from 2019 to 2022. So they did overbuilt, they acknowledged it, and they needed to do one or two rounds of cuts, and they've done the two rounds of cuts. As long as we don't go into a steep recession, I don't think they need to do another round of cuts. But doing those cuts was necessary. You also had a bit of a change in but you've had a major change in management over the last two years. It's given a new CEO who's been with the company for 20 years. So he's not new to Amazon by any means. But it gets given them some time to maybe look through all the portfolio of bets, and assets that Amazon hasn't maybe pair some things back maybe not lose $10 billion a year on Alexa, which was a reported number, which was terrifically high. So anyway, I think I think that's kind of what you're getting out of Amazon, which is they're getting deep now into belt-tightening. And I do think that at the end of the day, when we come out of this, and when we get back to more normal economic times, companies are going to be doing this on the lower cost base. And that means you create what I call these EPS slingshot opportunities. So when the revenue recovers on a lower cost base, that means that earnings can grow much faster. And that can be a great long equity opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Let's definitely hope that it will be really quick, Mark, before I get you out of here. I know that you are recently out in Las Vegas for the PROSPER show, which is a gathering of E-commerce sellers and solution providers just really quickly for all the rest of us who were not able to attend the show. What insights did you take away about the Amazon marketplace from that show?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, it's still remarkably a positive experience for most sellers that are on there. And I think you're seeing a lot of them. I guess one of them the most part, the single most interesting takeaway for me was, I think it was 8 out of the 10. Amazon Marketplace, sellers that we spoke to are currently using advertising on Amazon. And Amazon don't tell anybody this but they're generating close to $40 billion a year in advertising revenue, they're going to be the next $100 billion a year ad revenue company. And that's not going to be next year or the year after. But sometime in the next three to five years. They'll be up there. I mean, they're gonna be in spitting distance of Facebook and Google. And because it's a high-intent platform and marketers and advertisers love to be in high-intent platforms. So that was probably the biggest takeaway. Merchants really like advertising on Amazon, watch this space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Wow. Well, the faculty said they're going to be in spitting distance of those big behemoths like Google and Facebook. That's definitely something to watch. As always, we love when you come on Public lot to share your insights. Once again, everyone this is Mark Mahaney, the senior managing director and head of internet research team over at Evercore ISI.

All right. Let's do it. Folks. Welcome one and all public live. I'm your host this afternoon. JD Durkin. I'm so happy to be here with all of you today learning about the evolving air transportation space and how Blade is bringing innovation to the world of travel. I am thrilled to welcome our special guests for the afternoon. Will Heyburn the CFO of blade welcome to Public Live. Great to have you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill Heyburn:\u003c/strong\u003e Thanks so much for having me very excited to be here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin:\u003c/strong\u003e Of course my man. It's great to have you. So Blade provides of course air transportation alternatives to pretty congested ground routes. And for those of us who live in New York City, we know that that's basically a daily occurrence. And you bring those alternatives to communities all around the world. Will, help break down Blades passenger segment offering and its value add.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill Heyburn:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, so just real quick, you know, Blade is really focused on those use cases for air mobility that can be profitable today. So we're laser-focused on areas where you have that addressable market of customers where we can save them a tremendous amount of time, for a price that's going to be competitive to ground transportation. As a reminder, we're doing this in an asset-light fashion, we don't own or operate any aircraft. And that's what allows us to grow so quickly expand so quickly, and do it in an extremely capital-efficient way. This also allows us to be really nimble between different markets, depending on the macro environment, and be 100% Ready for the future electrification of air mobility, which we think will be coming soon with electric vertical aircraft that are gonna allow you to fly more quietly, which means communities are going to let you land more places, but are also going to let you do that in a more cost-effective manner. So we're focused on doing that and both passenger and medical where we're the largest transporter of human organs in the United States for transplant. But I'll start with your question. On passenger. Like I said, we're laser-focused on places where we can save folks a huge amount of time. And so for us today, that's in Canada, Western Canada, between Vancouver and Victoria, where we're taking what would be a three four-hour journey of car trips, Ferry rides, and we're turning that into a 30-35 minute helicopter flight between Vancouver and Victoria landing right in the middle of the city center for between $200 and $300. We're also in New York City where you already mentioned, we can take your two to three-hour trip between Manhattan and JFK make that a five-minute flight that starts at $195. If you're trying to get an Uber in New York, you know, it can often be more expensive than that. And then we're in southern France flying between Nice and Monaco, for about $200. That's a seven-minute flight. And also between Nice and Saint Tropez. And in the winter we fly between Geneva of course Courchevel and other ski destinations. These are the places in the world where for not a lot of money for something that costs very similar to what you might pay for ground transportation, we can save our customers a tremendous amount of time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, that's awesome to hear. And it's very appealing to me. I live in Queens and yet JFK is also in Queens Yet somehow it still always takes me an hour just to get to JFK. So I'm sure there's more than a few of us listening to your last response. You say, Oh, my goodness, that sounds like a great alternative versus the MTA Blade does not only offer passenger transportation services well, but like you said, a growing medical transport segment. Let's talk the numbers though it reached $71.8 million in Q4 revenue growing 120%. Year over year. What is this segment entail? And why do you think you've been able to experience such high growth?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill Heyburn:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, so just a quick clarification, the $71.8 million is the full-year revenue for 2022. But you're right. It's been growing triple digits year-over-year organically for the last several quarters, incredibly fast growth. And you know, the interesting thing about how we got started in medical, for better or for worse in New York City, we've always had 24/7 availability of crews, largely in case somebody wanted to go to Atlantic City in the middle of the night, which used to happen all the time. And we realized one day we've got all these aircrafts sitting around ready to go, incredibly affordable prices. Because we're flying them all the time to airports out to Long Island, we realized that we could actually help the hospitals here in New York, and we could provide them service to go pick up organs and get do it much more cost-effectively and much more quickly than any of the providers they've been using before. So we started just in our own home base here we're based in New York City, working with NYU Langone, we added Mount Sinai and we very quickly became the largest transporter of human organs here in the Northeast. And we realized it's the same aircraft for organ transportation. So quick primer on organ transportation. There's a group called UNOS here in the United States. This is the governing body that allocates organs to potential transplant recipients so that organization is going to say this donor could be a match with this recipient. And then they turn it over to the quarterback of any transplant mission, which is the transplant center or the hospital that is going to be putting that organ inside the recipient. So that is our customer. That is our credit. We don't have to deal with any insurance. We don't have to deal with reinsurance reimbursements. We're always getting paid from that hospital, that's our customer and they're generally two to three-year contracts. But where we really shine is all the same jets that we might be using for you to go between Palm Beach and New York City or the helicopters that we're using during the day to fly between JFK and Manhattan. Those same aircraft are what we utilize primarily at night to move organs for these hospitals. And you may or may not know, one of the biggest components of the cost of flying aircraft is the fixed costs, the salaries for the pilots, the liability insurance, and the lease payment you might pay as an operator to lease that aircraft from a lessor. Those are all costs that are borne by our network of third-party operators. But they also cost that if you fly more hours, you're now amortizing that fixed costs over more hours. So it actually costs you less to fly. So that's the magic of putting those two businesses together and Blade by having use cases during the day for our passengers. And use cases that are primarily at night for medical, we can offer the operators that fly on our behalf more hours, and we can eliminate some of their fixed costs, for example, they don't need customer service anymore, because we're doing all that mostly with our technology. And because they're flying that fixed costs over more hours, it costs everybody less to fly, they make more money, and we can pass through some savings to hospitals. And we have a very competitive product, we think the lowest-cost product in the United States to move organs for hospitals, and it allows them to go after more potential transplants. That's another really important point and our organ transportation business, because we're asset-light because we have aircraft distributed across the United States, ready 24/7. We can source an aircraft, that's not only the exact right size that a hospital needs at the exact right time, but increasingly at the exact right place. So it's a fragmented industry, most hospitals used to work with a mom-and-pop operator of a couple of aircraft that were based right near their hospital. The problem with that is that every trip needs to be a round trip. And a lot of times in organ transportation, you think you might pick up an organ and then pawn visual inspection, it's actually not going to be a match for the recipient. So if you're working with an operator that's based right near where you are, you're always going to have to pay for that full round-trip transportation, if you're working with Blade will have an aircraft on standby near the location where the donor is located, you can visually inspect that organ. And if it's not a match, you only pay a couple $1,000, you can imagine how overtime over a year, it costs the hospital so much less. And it also enables them to go after more organs. So you know, it's exciting that this is a great growing business. It's profitable for Blade on a segment-adjusted EBITA basis. But it's even more exciting for me and the team here that we have enabled hospitals to go after more organs than they otherwise might have been able to, because they have the confidence that not they're not going to be stuck with the bill.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin:\u003c/strong\u003e Will, I'd like to ask you a little bit about maybe some potential headwinds or challenges in this particular macroeconomic environment. Obviously, for all the talk about a recession, a lot of people are just sort of looking at the jobless claims and the numbers and the job cuts. And they're saying this a little bit more of a tech session or maybe a rich session. And given your kind of client base there. Are you seeing that kind of squeeze in terms of consumer spending among wealthier clientele, given some of the jobless numbers that we've seen across the country? And how, you know, some demographics of spenders may be hit more than others?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill Heyburn:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, well, look, we think we've built an incredibly resilient business on both sides of the house on the passenger and medical side. Obviously, on the medical side, it's hard to get more recession-proof than saving folk's lives by moving in organs, where you got one moment in time to get that to a recipient who needs it to save their life. But on the passenger side, we have extremely resilient customers, as we talked about even looking quarter to date as of our earnings call last week. For passenger, we're seeing a near doubling of our airport business in New York versus the prior year period, we had a record for airports here in New York, we've seen great results from being able to take price increases in some of our key markets, like New York to Long Island, where some routes we raise price up to 30%. We think we have great pricing power. We think we're targeting a unique group of people that's extremely resilient in any economic environment. And then the most important thing is right, we've got that asset light model. So if you look at our gross profit margin across the last several years, even through the pandemic, when of course, on the passenger side of the business, we saw a significant drop of volumes, what you saw is that our flight margins stayed very strong. That's because we don't have the fixed cost associated with flying that you would have if you owned a bunch of aircraft. So we're incredibly nimble. And if you ever did need to reallocate resources between medical and passenger or throttle capacity up or down, you'd be able to do that and still maintain really strong flight profit margins. Now, we haven't seen anything to suggest that there's any weakness in our flyer, but we're incredibly cool. afforded by the fact that we've got these two complementary business lines using the same aircraft assets to fly. And the asset-light model gives us a tremendous amount of flexibility. So I'm incredibly excited. I'm excited that we're still seeing growth, significant growth, particularly in markets like New York City. So so we're really feeling good at any macro environment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin\u003c/strong\u003e: Absolutely. I do want to try and squeeze in these last two if I can first in the in the last quarter Blade completed its first test flights of an EVA, that's electrical vertical aircraft. You mentioned it a bit earlier with its partner Beta Technologies. Talk to us a bit more about EVA's and Blade's ambitions for this new aircraft, if you can.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill Heyburn:\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely, we think this could be an incredible boost to the passenger and the medical business. On the medical side of the house. There are a lot of areas where you don't have access to rotorcraft, they're just too remote. And those machines are too expensive to be based on air all the time. And as a result, you might have a two-three hour drive to the nearest airport from a hospital where a donor is sitting, a heart only has four hours in transit. So it kind of takes them out of the running to get it anywhere except somewhere local. If you had a less expensive electric vertical aircraft or even a drone. Now you could go after organs that maybe you couldn't otherwise do on the passenger side of the business. Everything we're doing that 10-200 mile trip is specifically designed with electric vertical aircraft in mind. And the most important thing I can stress is that these aircrafts are quiet. The number one limiting factor in terms of creating new places that we can land is the noise that the community believes that helicopters could bring. By bringing an aircraft that's near silent and flight completely silent the moment after it shuts, it sits down because you can turn those rotors off immediately. Unlike a turbine holograph copter where they have to keep spinning, you can start adding new spokes onto our key hubs. So we have exclusive terminal infrastructure in places like New York, no one else has a heliport terminal at West 30 Street, East 34th street, you simply couldn't offer a service like ours in New York City, if you didn't have those exclusive terminals that we have. What we see from EVA is creating new places to fly to and from those key hubs that we had, if you had a heliport in Stamford, Connecticut, people could start commuting in, but it'd be very difficult to compete with us if you didn't have the infrastructure we have in New York City. So we're really employing a strategy of building those key hubs, those locations where urban air mobility can be profitable today with helicopters, building that moat in terms of customers that already fly the infrastructure that's exclusive to our technology that's specifically designed to operate this mission and a brand that's recognized around the whole world at this point so that when those electric vertical aircraft are ready for commercial use, we're already the market leader and we've got a huge head start.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin:\u003c/strong\u003e Finally, here Will, before I let you go, United Airlines previously invested $15 million into Air Mobility and also agreed to purchase 200 of its EVA's electrical air taxis. Talk to me about how Blade is viewing competition as an industry in terms of electrical air taxis and as the industry develops\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill Heyburn:\u003c/strong\u003e As we've learned from our passenger and a medical business, you know, one size fits all does not apply to aviation, you need a different aircraft to fly an organ between New York and Boston than you might use to just fly that five minutes between JFK and Manhattan. So we're all about having a diversity of aircraft in our accessible fleet. And that's why we're staying in Switzerland and the electric vertical aircraft business, we're going to use the best aircraft for any given mission, our asset-light model allows us to pick the winners in terms of what aircraft is going to be most appropriate for each market, we're not putting a stake in the ground in terms of we have to use this aircraft here, this aircraft there. So we're very excited to work with all the electric vertical aircraft manufacturers, to the extent they create an aircraft that's going to work for our customers from a payload and cost perspective. So there's a lot still to learn about electric vertical aircraft. And Blade gives you the optionality, right? We've got customers, we've got them on roofs where we can make money, even with helicopters. And so if electric vertical aircraft are going to be slightly less expensive, which is what all the manufacturers today do, we can feel very confident that they should work well on the routes we're already operating. And we do not have our hands tied in terms of having to use one particular kind of aircraft because it's hard to know at this stage, who's going to be first to market and which aircraft is going to make the most economic sense. So we're trying to cast a wide net rather than pigeonhole ourselves with one particular manufacturer or one particular route, one particular place. So we think we're set up to be much more flexible than the competition and you know, at the end of the day, we have the customers and we have the passengers that are already flying. You can take a jog on the West Side Highway and you can see people getting into a Blade helicopter every 15-20 minutes. And we think that's going to make all the difference. Right on\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eAlright, that's Will Heyburn CFO of Blade. Will, thanks a lot for taking the time. It was a great conversation.

Happy Thursday and welcome to Public live. I am your host Kinsey Grant. So on Tuesday of this week, financial technology company MoneyLion released its Q4 and fiscal year 2022 earnings reports, so joining me to walk through the numbers and tell us more about MoneyLion and its future is Rick Correia, CFO of MoneyLion.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRick Correia: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHi, thanks for having me.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOf course.

Before we dive into the nitty gritty and the details of their earnings reports. Can you just explain to anybody who might not be familiar with MoneyLion what you do? Tell me about the company?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRick: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, absolutely. At our core, we help connect customers with the right product, financial product, so whether that's a first party product or a third party product, you know, it's an authentic way for us to give our customers advice and content and at the same time, just making sure that you have all their financial needs met.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAbsolutely, certainly makes a ton of sense. So let's get into the earnings report from earlier this week. So on the earnings call, you reiterated three key takeaways for investors. I would love it if you could recap what those three key takeaways were for our listeners today.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRick Correia: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, so let me just, I want to read something from the Fun Police or lawyers, which is that as we're going through the financials or anything that I'm talking about, unless it's otherwise stated, I'll be referring to our non-GAAP adjusted results. And so you can see the appendix in our earnings release available on our IRS site for any of our GAAP results and reconciliations of each non-GAAP measure to the comparable GAAP measure. And then, of course, you can always find our latest earnings presentations on moneyline.com.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo with your question, in terms of the three key takeaways that we highlighted on our earnings call, the first was that we reached a significant milestone, which is we reached positive adjusted EBITDA in the month of December. This also marked our fourth consecutive quarter of adjusted EBITDA improvement. And so we're really proud of this milestone we've been working towards optimizing growth and profitability. And as everyone can appreciate a really dynamic market environment.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe others that we announced that we expect to generate positive adjusted EBITDA for the full year of 2023. There aren't many of us in this kind of competitive space that can say that. And it's another great milestone for us as we turn the quarter corner towards delivering really kind of profitable growth at scale. And then we also surprise the analyst community by being months ahead of our EBITDA targets. So in terms of our Q4 results, our Q4 adjusted EBITDA came in ahead of expectations at the 6 million adjusted EBITDA or negative Don number was an improvement from 32 million a year prior and Q4 ‘21. And this was really driven by the performance in our consumer business, seeing the continued benefits of a lot of the operating leverage that our business was built to realize as well as around 15 million of annualized run rate, fixed cost savings that we actioned during the fourth quarter.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe second takeaway that was important for our investors is that we added over a million total customers in Q4. And we did that at a remarkably low CAC, which you've probably been following us is really kind of one of the things that differentiate us, and that's under a $10 CAC. And so we've been able to grow while actually reducing our marketing spend, and specifically reducing it with the paid digital channel. So you know, when you look at the Googles and the Facebooks of the world, those channels are becoming increasingly expensive. And so we benefit from having a unique way in terms of driving our top funnel. And we do that by having over 30 million inquiries a quarter. You know, that gives us a tremendous number of customers data and importantly intent that we can then optimize to, as I said at the beginning of this match customers with the right suite of products.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe third key takeaway is that we reached quarterly adjusted to be EBITDA of 92 million in Q4 of ‘22, and this is up 70%, over the prior year quarter. And so for the full year of 2022, we had an adjusted revenue that increased nearly 100%, year over year to 328 million. And so because of this kind of diversified consumer and enterprise business model, we're able to continue delivering really strong performance across economic cycles. And so that's really the kind of key three takeaways that we wanted our investors to take away from the business update that we provided yesterday.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAwesome. Yeah, I appreciate all that insight. And I think that we'll get more into this consumer and enterprise product lineup in just a couple of minutes here. But before we do get to that, with all of these key takeaways in mind, knowing that there are some pretty impressive stats and you know, some important numbers that you and your team shared earlier this week, I would love if you could just explain the context behind all of this, you know, not necessarily how you got there, but more so what does this mean? What do these big three key takeaways mean, for investors - for adding value for investors? Tell me a little bit about that.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRick Correia: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, so when you look at why these matters, so much for us is one, it's unique for a company that has kind of both our growth trajectory and profitability trajectory, to meet the needs of our customers in such a meaningful way. And so whether our customers are experiencing, you know, times of need, or they have times of excess, we're able to deliver for them, either our first party or our third party products. And so when you think about the context of this, we exited the year, with 6.5 million total customers. And so our definition of customers are monetized customers, as opposed to just those that kind of browse our platform. And that's important, because it means that we're going to be delivering value to them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe second reason, when you look at the number of products that were taken by those customers, it's nearly 13 million. And so that's a really nice blend of both first party products that we provide, as well as third party products. And so it means they're actually meeting the needs of our consumers. And then we ended the year with over 1000 enterprise partners. And we'll touch upon this a bit more later, when you look at what we have, from an enterprise business perspective, we have one of the leading financial marketplaces out there. And so that means that we're helping our customers kind of get matched with product providers so that we're meeting their needs authentically. And then we amassed over 33 million unique customer profiles across our platform. And so what's really important about that is if you look at the recurring revenue profile of both of our consumer and enterprise businesses, it means that our customers are coming back to us, because we're actually helping them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo on the consumer side, for example, over 75% of our revenue comes from our historical cohorts, whether it's kind of pre 2019, or 2020, or 2021, and even 2022. Every day that we wake up, over 75% of our revenue are coming from customers that we acquired historically. And then on the enterprise side, we have a similar type of profile, we have over 80% of our enterprise customers that represent revenue – recurring revenue that we are realizing. And so what does that mean, again, we wake up every day, and we are generally generating over 80% of our revenue in the enterprise side from historical cohorts.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThen just digging down into the customers. You know, the thing that we have been proud about doing within MoneyLion is having some of the leading unit economics. So we've kind of talked about the customers that we added in the fourth quarter, we added just over a million of them. And we did that, as I mentioned earlier at about an $8 CAC. And so if you went back a year that you know, our CAC was in the 20s, and every quarter, we've been able to improve our CAC and kind of keep it at that low level, because of the unique type of funnel that we have. That then translates into a two month payback period. And importantly, we're able to do that at a really strong ARPU, and so our ARPU was at over $60. And again, while we're spending less than $10, to acquire them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat. So you know, with all these numbers in mind, and noting, especially to your final point, you just made here the trend that these numbers seem to be following and these metrics seem to be following, they appear to be pretty significant for the money line and for the future of your business. And I'm curious about the general circumstances in which these numbers were tallied, you know, you think about the macro climate, the economic circumstances that any business would be facing in most of last year, certainly at the end of last year. I'm curious about how those macro circumstances impacted the financials that you reported and also, you know, how they might impact the way that you go about the future quarters. You know, once we get past the quarters that you were, of course reporting on earlier this week. Tell me a little bit about your perspective and your take on everything that's happening in the macro sense and how it impacts your business?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRick Correia: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, that is a great question. You know, one of the things that's unique about where we are positioned is we have a really interesting window into the American consumer. We also have an interesting window into a lot of the market participants on the enterprise side, right? The kind of big channels where customers are looking for products, as well as those big companies that are delivering those financial products. And so with those windows, where we kind of have a good sense of how the consumer is performing and behaving. And I think what we see right now is they're, they're pretty resilient still. And we're uniquely positioned because of this mix between our consumer and enterprise business. So on the consumer side, we're continuing to see consumers having a lot of demand for financial products and demand for credit. And demand for the kind of higher yield savings that they're seeing, you know, are very different than the type of yield that they receive in their deposit accounts, one, two, three years ago.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd then on the enterprise side, you know, channel partners are still seeing a lot of consumers spending time looking for ways to kind of improve their financial lives. We have seen, you know, some headwinds, from the kind of product providers where just kind of given the raising rate environment, you know, they're having to step back or tighten their risk box, which means it just isn't as much available, as we kind of saw in late Q3 and certainly part of Q4 of ‘22 customers having access to that. And so I think what's been important is having, for us, both a consumer business and an enterprise business allows us to be able to continue to hit our financial targets, because they kind of work as almost a hedge where what we've seen with the consumer side is we're able to kind of drive more and more kind of transaction fees, those type of direct deposit interchange revenue lines, as we kind of saw some headwinds, as I said, with the enterprise side of the business. With that position, just really to your question about what it means for the future, it means that we'll be able to continue to execute and realize the momentum that we've been having. If you look at the overall mix of our business, from an enterprise and consumer perspective, you know, consumer is about 65% of the revenue mix in enterprise is about 35%. And that's a slight shift more towards consumer relative to what we were expecting, you know, six months ago, we thought we'd start trending more and more towards 50-50. But again, that's a benefit for us, as we start to see that the shift or the tailwinds that we see in the consumer side, tend to offset some of the headwinds that we see on the enterprise side.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTotally and noting, to your point that this could, in some ways, behave as a hedge that you have these two forks in the business. I'm curious about how, you know, it might be what the experience might be building both a consumer and an enterprise part of the business, in what could be construed as, as volatile economic circumstances or a volatile economic environment? Is that a difficulty for MoneyLion? And if so, tell me about how you try to, you know, establish these two business entities or, you know, I don't want to suggest that they're separate entities, but two parts of your business that serve a different customer? Is it difficult to develop both of those and to mature both of those at the same time, knowing that the economic climate is not the most hospitable?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRick Correia: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, another great question, which so, I think fortunately, for us, it's all built. You know, certainly there are always optimizations and improvements that you're doing. But we are, you know, easily the most full featured offering out there from a financial bank perspective that exists. So for some companies that might have a feature as an entire company, we have that embedded, it's just a feature. So for example, like a round ups. And so if you kind of looked at the MoneyLion app, from a consumer perspective, it's fully built, it's the most full featured product that exists out there, we encourage people to download the app and play around with it, it's free, you get access to incredible kinds of content. And then the more that you interact with it, the more personalized it becomes, and the more that we're able to help people\u0026nbsp; access the right mix of financial products. And so, you know, from an enterprise perspective, you know, there are always ways to continue to improve.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo to give people a little more transparency into what that means from an enterprise perspective, we are a network and we're a technology company. What we help our channel partners do is we allowed them to be able to have a very flexible, different ways in which they can basically use our technology, you can kind of have an embedded piece of software, we can host an entire white label type of site for you, you can kind of have a mobile version of it. And that allows our channel partners to kind of optimize the way in which they want to have customer experience to meet their needs. And however, basically, those channel partners are kind of routing customers to us, or people that have high intent to us, on the other side of the equation, are our very fast set of product partners. And again, we have deep integration, and we give them software that allows them to kind of tweak the way in which they want to see customers, the type of customers, they want to see the frequency to help them meet their needs. And so for that perspective, again, that's already all built. Of course, we're always looking at ways to optimize the funnel, we're always looking at ways to add more and more new types of enterprise web services that we can deliver to those partners.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut you know, when we look at the macro environment ahead, and it's incredibly difficult to kind of look forward and think about what that macro can unveil for our business. But we're confident because whichever way the market kind of tilts over the next coming quarters, we're going to either kind of realize our plan, or we're going to be able to take advantage of credit partners and the credit boxes, the risk boxes that will widen back up. And that allows us to kind of further you know, meet that on that demand that we're seeing. It's increasing quarter over quarter from the client side with products that meet their needs. So we think that at a minimum for us, we execute against our plan, we get to EBITDA positive over the year, and with some tailwinds, and with some kind of macro positive news, you know, the kind of back after the year we get to kind of spring load into outperformance.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, makes a ton of sense. And I think this answer specifically speaks to some of MoneyLion’s potential competitive advantages moving into the future. So with that in mind, I would love to just hear your perspective broadly about the future of the FinTech space, what is exciting to you right now?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRick Correia: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI think what's exciting, and we're excited because we kind of play a really unique position within the FinTech space, which is I think, some people try to kind of pigeonhole us into being, you know, a neobank, or patroness into being, you know, a lender or petitioners into being kind of a robo-advisor. We are all of the above. But importantly, we're really just that interface layer to the customer. And so what we are able to do is really kind of play that kind of Swiss role, where we are a data company and a technology company that is able to take our customer and give them access to the right product. And that can be a product from any FinTech provider. So what's exciting about us as there is, more and more FinTech players are entering the space, they're always kind of driving innovation. And we get to take advantage of that by making those products available to our customers, whether it's an insurance, whether it's in mortgages, whether it's an auto refi, even when you start to look at some of the things that are kind of very budget intensive, so travel, spend on a car, things like that, we're even able to give our customers access to those types of, of non financial products through our partners, through our overall Money Lions membership or while membership. So it's a really exciting place to be in a space to be because we hope there are more and more market entrants into the FinTech space, and specifically on the product side so that we can make that available to our customer base.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, and we're certainly excited to watch how FinTech unfolds in the coming months and years. Certainly, it's been a very interesting past couple of weeks. I shouldn't even be that generous – the past couple of days following the FinTech space. So we are going to have to check back, Rick, and see how things pan out for the next couple of months and years. So with that, I want to thank our wonderful guests today, Rick Correia, CFO at MoneyLion for his time. Rick, thank you so much.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRick Correia: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThank you. I look forward to being back next quarter.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOf course. And thank you again to our partners at MoneyLion who made today's show possible. We will be back next month with even more news and updates from the FinTech economy. Thank you so much for listening, and I'll see you next time.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","eventType":"PUBLIC_LIVE","assetCategorization":["EXEC_Q_A"],"sponsorDetailsDto":{"sponsor":{"id":"4AZld8DNW0SHRqXId0wbVmvxC5OfvNaE","name":"MoneyLion","disclosure":"","imageUrl":""},"symbols":["ML"]},"audienceCohort":"ALL_MEMBERS","hosts":[{"publicId":"902e27b4-f7a8-41d1-b4b6-d03c446c5ffa","username":"kinsey","displayName":"Kinsey Grant","profilePictureURL":"https://prod-api.154310543964.hellopublic.com/static/users/images/Sosi4hWQpiDT3ZXndA3KXkEbz0Mpi2fi-thumbnail-300x300.jpg","verified":true,"isPrivate":false,"bio":"host of Thinking Is Cool","followedByMe":false,"following":false},{"publicId":"7236716d-cac0-42e1-b575-98ae067aa0eb","username":"rickcorreia","displayName":"Rick Correia","profilePictureURL":"https://prod-api.154310543964.hellopublic.com/static/users/images/nO9LTaZAkkxhrXlF4tkJcbJlGrUbU3E6-thumbnail-300x300.jpg","verified":false,"isPrivate":false,"bio":"CFO at MoneyLion","followedByMe":false,"following":false}],"stocks":[{"symbol":"ML","name":"MoneyLion"}],"slug":"https://app.public.com/live/stock-market/interview-with-moneylions-cfo","uniqueId":"m2kA8FGqPRsJAnX6dr9Zsm7gV9TLMXOP","status":"PUBLISHED","linkedIds":["nw96ZGLbPoxnVotZydc80nXCMYoY9GUn","XZ6CgnSgEC1SWKGctrmeZ9353WDgj1SL"],"cta":{"buttonText":"Sign up","title":"Interview with MoneyLion's CFO","subtitle":"Invest in stocks, ETFs, cryptos, alts, and more.

","transcript":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Hello, everyone, and good afternoon and welcome to Public Live this Thursday, March 9th. I am your host, Kori Hale and today folks, we're going to be discussing Spotify’s recent Stream On event and be updating you on Metas year of efficiency as well as other big tech news. And I'm excited because this is one of my favorite guests we have on the show with us today. It's Mark Mahaney, senior managing director and head of the internet research team over at Evercore ISI. Mark is also if that wasn't enough, and it is but he is also the author of a new book titled Nothing But Net 10 times stock picking lessons for one of Wall Street's top tech analysts. And of course, right here on Public, we're doing book giveaway. So if you want to get your hands on a copy, just send a DM to the public alive handle. Alright, Mark, welcome back to public life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e It's good to be back, Kori.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e We're always happy to have you join us. And of course, you break down as some of these big tech names on Wall Street, as I mentioned, and we got to talk about Spotify. The streaming platform recently hosted its Stream On event and announced many new features planned for the app. For those of us who maybe did not catch that announcement, could you provide some insight into some of the standout features that were discussed?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMark Mahaney: Okay, I think this was their fifth annual Stream On event. It's kind of their product. It's like their customer event, but it's really kind of a product development event. I guess that's what it is. It's it's like, it's like Apple's worldwide developer conference. Now not nearly as impactful or meaningful as that, but it's just this is where they roll out their latest innovations. So there was some new disclosure to the founder, Daniel Eck, the CEO announced that they are now over half a billion monthly visitors, which means that monthly average users, which means that they're now a little bit ahead of their guidance for the March quarter, it's a small thing for the financial folks out there. Second is they disclose that Spotify recommendations are powering more than half of users streams. And why that matters is you know, the more that Spotify is music, people who listen to Spotify, listen to curated music, rather than just going on there and saying, you know, I want this song by Taylor Swift, the extent to which they kind of give the wheel, give the mic, give the turntable that's the right one, Kori, give the turntable to Spotify and say, play me something interesting. That means that Spotify becomes more influential, and that means that artists then want to pay to kind of influence To that influence, or that they're willing to advertise, you know that that creates more of an opportunity for them, you know, the, the retailer who simply just fulfills, doesn't generate margins as nice as the retailer who actually suggests and can and can influence tastes and patterns and things like that. And then the last thing that I thought was interesting is they have a new home feed that's coming out. And I think it's a little bit what I would call the TikTok isation of Spotify. So you're gonna see more TikTok-like features short-form video kind of right up front, you can see sort of a little bit of endless feed is the wrong word, but you're gonna see some of that you're gonna see more than just the static feed when you start. So these are all going to all these little nuances that sort of improve, they also talked about an AI DJ, I'm not sure we're going to really notice a difference, but we'll try it out. And then a new ad format, that's kind of a small video ad format, anything that generates ad revenue for Spotify is going to be good for their gross margins. So those are the features that came out of Spotify’s Stream On on event yesterday,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Mark, I love that you brought up actually a plethora things that I want to really quickly piggyback off of. And also, we probably have lots of Swifties in our audience, and they probably were like, Mark, we only play Taylor Swift straight through. We don't need any sort of DJ for that. But the interesting thing about what I are what came to my mind was Payola back in the day, which I might be dating myself back in the radio days, when radio was a massive thing, right in artists, more so record labels are paying radio DJs right to play their particular artists. Are you saying then since there's more of this suggesting type of thing that's going to happen with Spotify going forward that there could be some streaming Payola-ish version at some point?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, you're using a very loaded word and Payola and you know, in some senses, that's what it is. But in some senses, maybe we need to rethink it a little bit. So when you use Google search engine, do you think about all those paid ads within Google as Payola? In other words, you know, when when you do a search for, you know, tickets to March Madness games, basketball games, or when you do a search for, you know, Hawaiian, you know, budget, airfare, and you get these paid results in there. I mean, that's essentially I've thought about this as Google's I'm sorry, as Spotify, Googling it search results, you go on there, and you look at today's top country hits, or today's you know, whatever hit it, and hip hop, I think they've got it, they've got something, you know, for a Christian country, I mean, they've got every possible genre you can imagine in there. And if you're an emerging artist, and if you're in a label, you know, this is like, this is a target-rich environment. I mean, these are people listening to your genre, you're a new artist, you know, like to you to here's an opportunity for you to advertise your song so that Italy shows up somewhere in the queue. Now, many people may not listen to your music, but at least here's a chance to market or advertise. And so that's kind of how we think about it. And so I don't know if that answers your question. But that's what that's the exact intent behind Spotify. And what they've done is given labels the ability to market to advertise their newest labels, their newest features, their newest artists, one of the world's largest, most influential music platforms, if you can make it on Spotify, you can make it anywhere. Spotify makes or breaks artists. And then sorry, but that is true, given how they've got half a billion people who listen to the surface, and probably 250 million who listen to it on a daily basis. There's no music listening service outside of YouTube, that's any bigger any more influential than that. And so that's how I think about and I've always thought about it as a great opportunity last year, I think they generate about $200 million in revenue a little bit more than that, from this what is what I call this advertising revenue. I think it's good for Spotify’s business model. And I also do think it creates opportunities for us of the artists that are on Spotify, here's a chance for them to here's a chance for them to promote their work their blood, sweat and toil.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, you know what, Mark that makes me think what else do you think is good for Spotify his business model because right now you're holding a price target of $185 on their stock with an outperform rating. What is it beyond that? The fact that they're getting this half a billion monthly active users that really, you know, has you all over at Evercore ISI so pro Spotify?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, I am pro Spotify. I was pro-Spotify last year Kori I think you remember that. And the stock tanked. I thought we were going to have an inflection point last year we didn't. And I thought I meant that in terms of gross margins. This is why I like Spotify here and I may be wrong again. You know, but I'm trying to get it right this time. So one, we know that the multiple has come down dramatically on this one This thing goat used to go at four or five, six times, he'd be, you know, enterprise value to sales. Now we're sub two times like that's cheaper than Netflix is cheaper than, well, sort of online dating companies which are somewhat similar. I mean, this is a subscription business and an advertising business, although it's mostly a subscription business. So I think it's cheap. I think the estimates have been de-risk. I think the multiple has then been de-risked. They've started taking some cost actions, they probably overbuilt like a lot of tech companies. So they've been taking some cost actions. But why I particularly like the setup this year, is that I think you're finally at a place where you're going to cut back on some of that podcast investment, heavy spending that they've had. So I think you're finally going to get gross margins to move up. For low gross margin businesses. When you see gross margins move up, it's almost always a major catalyst for the stock. Second is they are likely to implement a price increase their biggest competitors, Apple and Amazon have both implemented a price increase. So it gives it kind of raises the umbrella a little bit and allows them to raise prices. Usually, that's a good thing for companies and for and for stocks. And then the third thing is Kori, last year, they had a record number of new users globally they added the number was something like 70 million. And what typically happens with Spotify is people come on as free users. And then over time, they kind of migrate a decent number of migrate over to be paid subscribers. So if the pick of the record MAU growth last year converts into paid subscriber growth, boom, I got my third catalyst for this year. So that's why I like it. I think the thing can recover to sort of like two times EV to sales. I just don't think that's an aggressive multiple. I know we're in a tough market for for growth equities. This year. This is a company that's been consistently free cash flow positive, admittedly a very small, minimal level, but I do like it and I think it's it's the leading way to play music streaming worldwide. So that's why we that's why we're pitching Spotify is one of our top longs this year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e See Mark just because you were wrong last year, that doesn't mean you're wrong. This year. We're not even before three months into the year and Spotify obviously doing pretty well. However, competition this year for Spotify, right also completely ticking up. This is no pun intended specifically with TikTok, right. This is a major competitive threat. Spotify has, you know, acknowledged this, you know, as part of their business model the company is working to obviously expand its streaming globally. TikTok has already said that, do you actually see Tik Tok as a threat to Spotify? Especially with maybe the legal issues by legal I mean regulatory issues around TikTok in the US.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Kori I may be wrong, but I don't think so. I think the bigger competitive risk really is Apple Music. YouTube music, Amazon music. Those are kind of the more direct So, let's see. Yeah, I think I'm not sure the competition is greater. But yes, TikTok has got a, you know, huge audience worldwide. It's one of those things where can the brand really be stretched? Are people going to really think about like, TikTok is a wonderful experience for you know, for consumers. It's just highly entertaining, addictive, maybe, but also truly highly entertaining. But it's a different type of entertainment than music. And I'm in one of the problems that TikTok is apparently having is getting the rights that Spotify spent a lot of time getting from the labels. So I just, I'm not at all sure that TikTok is going to come out and directly compete with, with Spotify. I'll take the other side on that I may be wrong. I worry about the other companies. But I've just noticed in the seven years I've been running surveys on Spotify, every year, they seem to gain more share of ear can I say that, share of ear you know, like their their share of people listening to streaming music on Android devices. And by the way on Apple devices has pretty consistently risen over the last couple of years. So they're doing something right the real issue on the stock and why it hasn't done anything since its IPO is or direct listing is the business model and people want to see the gross margins go up people want to see them start generating substantial amounts of free cash flow they generate minimal amount but let's get chunky. Let's get a lot of free cash flow. I think they can start gapping up that gross margin this year start growing it I think 10 People can start believing again that there can be sizable free cash flow and that could cause the rewriting in the stock to go up this year. That's why I like it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e All right. No, I I'm with you on that Mark. I want to shift really quickly while we have some time though and cover another big tech company which is Facebook's parent company Meta they're entering into their year of efficiency are since entering I guess it's continuing as the social media giant is expected to layoff thousands more or employees as early as this week. Might I also add it is not lost on me that a company that's shifting into a year of efficiency, which is away from the metaverse after they changed the parent company name to Meta is a lot of questions in my mind around that. However, this is the second largest scale cut these layoffs by Meta. How many more can investors expect as part of this year of efficiency?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I do think it's necessary the year of efficiency. You know, we there's two factors that are going on here. One is that overall demand trends are softening for macro economic reasons. And so layoffs aren't fun. I've gone through them, you know that they're painful for everybody involved, especially if you're one of those people getting laid off. But you know, when times get tough, we all the households tighten their belts and companies need to tighten their belts. And one way you do that, is you unfortunately have to let go some of your employees. The other thing, though, that's one factor. But the other one that Jim maybe just as material and maybe more so is that there clearly are some companies that overbuilt post the COVID crisis, I think Amazon was one I think, Meta was one if you were to go back and look at the revenue growth between 2019 and 2022. And then the OPEX growth, your operating expense growth, you'll see there's a couple of companies that really stick out that they grew their expenses more than their revenue, even though revenue shot up materially between 2019 and 2022, the expenses grew even more. And I think these companies sort of assumed that there was this positive inflection and demand for the services that we kind of continue on for many, many years. That didn't happen. It's not like we've gained, it's not like we've reverted to 2019. It's just that the growth rates have kind of more normalized, rather than just kind of kept it accelerating level. Anyway, all of that is Meta was one of those companies, demand trends are softening for online advertising, no question about it as they are for all marketing spend, and this company over hired, and it's probably the right thing for them to do to take these layoffs. I you know, I think what's been reported recently, I think that is probably going to happen. There's enough there's enough smoke there. There's got to be some hiring fire. I think that's good. I think that actually was a surprisingly good pun. And then I'm going to use that in the note thank you, Kori. And then, but yeah, so I think that's happened. And I think it helps, what investors want to see is defend the bottom line, you know, you can't control what's going to happen to you know, ad marketers, and how much they're going to spend in a recession, you can control your cost basis, and show me that you're going to do that show me your grown-up company. And Zuckerberg kind of weaved and waved a little bit last year. But I think he got to the I think he finally I think most of the signals he gave were it Yes, I'm a mature company, CEO. I'm a CEO, I'm a mature CEO of a company, it may be a mature company. And we need to be much more careful about expenses. And it's not growth at all costs. And when he started to do that, I think he's been rewarded by the market. And I think there's more of that coming. And I also think that the revenue growth trends are going to improve at Facebook because I think they're improving their ad tracking their ad attribution models. And I think they're going to be able to better monetize reels, which I think has turned out to be phenomenally successful for both Instagram and Facebook in terms of new users and more engagement. So I really like Meta here. I think it's still cheap at 14 times earnings. And I think there's 50% upside in the stock. So it's actually my number one pick right now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Wow, number one pick. I didn't know that's where you were going with that mark. But that's that's a strong conviction there. Okay. Number one pick, you know what I was thinking to in the broader tech scheme, something I'd love to get your insights on. We don't have time to do it today. So we'll have to have another session. But I really want to pick your brain around chat GPT around Microsoft's login strategy, how you see that playing into revenue. What does that do to Google? Especially because you brought up ads of the like and how that all could really up in certain business revenue lines across different tech companies. I don't know if you've given that any thought but I'd love to hear what you have to say on that next time around. Next time around. All right, everyone. This was a great session. By the way I love this and I we always love when Mark comes on and shares his insights.

Joining us today is Paul Graves, CEO of Livent. Livent is a lithium manufacturer powering a range of technologies that impact our everyday lives, including the revolution in electric vehicle batteries and mobile devices. With that, Paul, thanks very much for joining us.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThanks, Ann. Good morning.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLet's start off with a brief overview of what Livent does. If you just break down the technology and applications of your products, that'd be super helpful.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, sure. You know, I'm sure we're gonna get into a little bit of conversation about what exactly lithium is, but Livent is the former FMC lithium, its predecessor company, started in the 1940s. So we've been around a long time, we basically make all the major forms of lithium, so the major funds lithium carbonate, lithium hydroxide, lithium chloride, lithium metal, and have done for many, many years. Our primary product, though, is lithium hydroxide, which is a form of lithium that is used in the manufacture of that higher nickel content batteries that you see in Teslas and other premium vehicles. So the bulk of our business today, at least, is lithium hydroxide.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI feel like I'm back at school in learning the periodic table with all the different formulations. So lots to keep up with. Tell us then a little bit about the partnerships that you have - Tesla, you mentioned BMW and General Motors, to what capacity are you guys working with the automotive and battery manufacturers?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eEach of these manufacturers and basically, most manufacturers, frankly, outside China today, are prioritizing batteries that are using a technology that is a high nickel battery. The reason they do that is simply more energy density and just the profile of that battery is more appropriate for what they're trying to do in terms of extended range, etc. To make those batteries as I said, they need lithium hydroxide. And the reason that they partner with us and we partner with them from their perspective, they're just very few places in the world where you can acquire lithium hydroxide of a quality and of a grade that is usable in a battery application, the process of qualifying can take a year. In fact, we know that one of our competitors spent almost six years getting qualified into a specific battery application.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo this is not a substitutable product and so you have to form partnerships. The same is true, by the way, for us because every single battery manufacturer wants slightly different characteristics in their lithium hydroxide. So also, they can't just run out and buy this product over the counter on a market. They can't they can't pick it up anywhere and just use it. There are some pretty large liability issues for battery failures for OEMs, and we've seen that in the past. And so this idea of having a very reliable, high quality supply of lithium hydroxide is really important to these OEMs.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhen we look at the underlying demand then for license products and we focus in on this EV and market how dependent in your mind Paul is us, EV adoption on government policies specifically?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou know, I think most EV adoption around the world is due to some form of government intervention, whether it's industrial policy in China, or whether it’s regulatory policy in Europe, particularly climate policy, or whether it's something in the middle, frankly, in the U.S. So every country is dependent on that. If the question is, how important is the US market to the global EV industry, it's easily the third out of the three major economic groupings in terms of lithium demand without me read your mind, with China clearly being way ahead of everybody else, Europe catching up quickly and the U.S.\u0026nbsp; very much in third place.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLet's talk about China then Paul has to start the year. We've seen headline declines and Evie demand numbers in China lithium prices in China down by nearly a third relative to November highs. What does that mean for your business? And is this a concerning trend?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou know, I'm going to tell you, the data just frankly, isn't reliable. We don't see prices falling in China, we haven't seen that. It's really a function of there's a lot of there's a lot of forces at work. But looking at a reference price in China, whether it's a fast market and SMM or whoever it may be, is trying to capture a marginal trade in a lithium product that is very rarely representative of the broader market. And I think you may have seen our earnings, you know, we're guiding the way that our average realized prices, is going to be significantly up year over year and we've certainly seen that in January.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd the same is true of EV sales. We always see a dip in January in China because of the lunar holidays. We just saw February data a day or two ago and EV sales in February were up 40% year over year. So we just don't see this dip in sales that everybody else is speaking to. And we certainly don't see any evidence of a reduction in demand for lithium products as a result.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e And just to put this in context, we live in what is the business's exposure to the Chinese market at a macro level?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou know, almost every battery maker today is producing a significant proportion of its cathodes – cathode materials in China, I think it's something like 80-85%, so for a lithium producer, it's extremely difficult to have no China exposure. Our business tends to be though, with Western applications for those cathodes. So we may supply them lithium hydroxide from our U.S.. plant which largely will go to Korea or Japan, or will supply from our China plant which will largely be processed in China, but the resulting cathode or battery or cell is leaving China and ending up in a western OEM.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLet's talk a little bit about some headline news that hit last week poor the world's largest electric vehicle battery maker contemporary Amperex Technology announced it was changing its pricing strategy and signing contracts with EV makers at “discounted prices.” \u003c/span\u003eWe saw lithium stocks including Livent you know, take a bit of a hit following that news. Could you just talk a little bit about your reaction to what is this something that's shaking up the market? Or is this a temporary hit to supply demand dynamics?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e I think the move in the share price, it shows you how emotional investors are about lithium, unfortunately. There's not a lot of analytics behind the way we trade on a daily basis. It’s clear what CATLR have offered is first and foremost, this offer is only as far as we can tell to Chinese OEMs. So it's not an offer to anybody else. Secondly, that OEM must commit to buy over 70% of their batteries from CATL. In order to achieve that, and then they will price the battery as though lithium is at I think for lithium carbonate $30 equivalent. CATL is frankly largely a carbonate based battery producer, not hydroxide, we don't have a massive amount of exposure to CATL. We do have some - not to any Chinese manufacturers that we're aware of.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI'd also point out that in 2022 Livent’s average realized price for lithium wasn't $30 it was lower than that. And so it's not like $30 is suddenly this catastrophic price. If you go back a couple of years, the industry really wasn't expecting to see pricing north of $20 for any sustainable period. So for CATL to say that now in the long run, they're gonna guarantee $30 I mean, to me, it just fundamentally is an acknowledgment and an admission that the historically low prices of lithium are not coming back.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo there's been an upward rebasing that's interesting. You know electric vehicles\u0026nbsp; have really captured the imagination of the market, and particularly here on Public. We see a lot of interest in that use case, but live it when you actually go and read about the company, your products are using so many more end markets, aerospace, pharmaceuticals, take us a little bit through some of those other end markets.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIt's interesting if you go back, not even six or seven years, we IPO’d in 2018. And the bulk of our business was not into automotive applications. And I think it was not until 2021 that it actually tipped over the edge. Even today in energy storage applications, EVs globally are between 55 and 60% of total installed capacity on a gigawatt hour basis. So EVs while they're \u0026nbsp; the biggest part of the energy storage industry, there's 40% or so that is non EV and application. For us, we have a little unusual business and I told you the beginning we have all the products and the lithium chloride and lithium metal chain, which by the way is the key to future solid state batteries will be the lithium metal side.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eToday, lithium metal is largely used in a product we make up utility. Put any chemist on the phone. And you'll get excited about utility for some bizarre reason. But it's a product that's used to manufacture lots of other stuff, everything from drugs, polymers, a whole bunch of synthesis applications, it's got very, very broad applications that makes about a third of our revenue today.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhen I look at your business pool, and folks can find this in your earnings results, in 2022 numbers, it looks like revenue came in at $813 million adjusted EBITDA at $367 million. So there's heft and scale to your business that's been engaging in a number of capacity expansion projects. Can you talk a little bit for us about what it is like to be undertaking expensive capital intensive construction projects in a rising rate environment?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, it's an interesting challenge for certainly being more profitable helps us fund this. We also have no net debt, we have about 200 million of cash on our balance sheet today. Largely, frankly, because customers are stepping up for companies like Livent that are credible, that can actually have demonstrated that we can actually producing usable lithium chains, they're willing to commit capital to help us expand. Expanding is hard, lithium is incredibly difficult to produce, because it really, really has two steps to it. And the vast majority of expansions or even companies out there with lithium in the name actually will never produce any usable lithium, they'll produce an intermediate.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhat we're trying to build is a fully integrated resource all the way through the chemical plant operations. We do that today, through our resource in Argentina. Our resource in Argentina was about 4,200 meters or 13,000 feet above sea level. So it's incredibly remote and there’s villages 110 kilometers away. And we are trying to put over a billion dollars of capital into expanding that mine and it just takes a long time. A lead time for items in every industry, but certainly because of the EV boom, the same is true of nickel or copper, there's a lot of overlap in material, it can take us two or three years to actually get pieces of equipment delivered. So it's an arduous and complicated process, to be perfectly honest.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd then just the last question for you, Paul, which touches on this issue of policy, you've talked about your footprint in China, you've just touched on your footprint in Argentina. How much.. and this is really at the industry level not necessarily at the moment level, how much are you seeing impetus, at least from a policy perspective to do more in your production process here in the United States?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaul Graves:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e It's a mixed bag and a mixed message. I think it's fair to say at the federal level, there's a desire to bring as much of the value on shore. The value if you think about the chain starts in mining run through chemical processing into manufacturing of cell components to the cells the cell packed and ultimately the vehicle. And I think it's probably far too fair to say that most policy starts at the vehicle and works its way backwards. And in terms of its desire to have the actual production on shore, there's a debate about whether they really want mining in the U.s. and that's certainly the case at the local level.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhen you get into states or local communities we do get huge push backs as an industry or in the mining industry about mining in the U.S. It’s different in Canada but in the U.S., it's not entirely clear to me that there's a big policy commitment to the mining. They do want the chemical process and we have a site at Bessemer city in North Carolina where we produce lithium hydroxide. We just built another 5,000 ton plant there and we've committed to build another 15,000 ton plant there. So there is definitely commitment to that but the material that feeds that plant will ultimately come from Argentina, not from a minor the U.S.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLots going on in the industry, everyone that was Paul Graves, CEO of Livent.

I'm your host Connor Round and I'm so happy to be here with you today to discuss the key themes in AI and the industries that it can bring innovation and growth to. I'm thrilled to welcome my guest today, Ivana Delevska, Founder and Chief Investment Officer at Spear Invest.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThanks for having me, Connor.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor Round: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo just to start off, you know, we're here to talk about artificial intelligence. It's an opportunity that has use cases beyond the human imagination. So just to start off when considering business applications of AI, could you help investors understand what industries and sectors you see greatly benefit from the innovations in the space?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYes, sounds great. Connor so many people under appreciate the fact that AI today is already a $100 billion industry and it's still in the very early innings. The main applications that we see it used in today would be for consumer technologies. So it would be for like recommenders in cases like TikTok or e-commerce where you're getting recommended products to buy. So that's one of the largest applications that we see today. But looking forward, we think AI will be transformational for many industries, traditionally industrials, automotive, life sciences. We think it's really going to have a transformative impact for the broader industrial complex.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eVery interesting. And could you just break down the AI capabilities that you see within the social media space?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWell, yeah, so it's interesting social media. Previously, all of the innovation or all of the use cases in AI were based on this recommender model. So basically, companies like TikTok would in-house train their their models to be able to tell based on few data points on videos that you watch, they're going to be able to form a whole profile about you, and then be able to, to recommend you other videos, and they can be really addictive as most people, most people have seen.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo that's kind of the main use case today. Now, the new thing in AI is this transformer model, which was the concept or the paper was written and introduced in 2016. But you've really seen these models just getting trained, these large language models. So Chat GPT, is one application of this large language model, it's based on a model called GPT 3 that was introduced in 2021. So a lot of people are excited about the applications of Chat GPT today, but I will highlight that this is just one kind of flavor of the opportunity that we see going forward.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat, I'm actually happy you brought up chat GPT that was just gonna go right into that. Apart from it kind of just expanding and, you know, breaking out into the scene very quickly. How do you see other companies reacting in the space? Do you see Google coming out with a new search engine capability? I'd love to hear your opinion on that.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, so we see Microsoft and Google, as potentially being leaders on the language side, Microsoft has maybe a head start, they've invested quite a bit here. And we've seen quite a lot from them. They're behind the GPT 3 language model, but they also recently announced an even newer model with even more parameters, 530 billion parameters, so we're gonna see a lot more from them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGoogle has been pretty quiet. They were maybe the leader several years ago. So we are waiting to hear what's going to come out of them. Investors believe that they have something, but it's kind of TBD. So as of right now, those are the two that are going to be leaders in the lead on the language model side. But it's very important for investors to realize that when you invest, you don't necessarily just want the direct beneficiary over trend, there is going to be a lot of investment in the infrastructure beyond behind like, behind AI. So for Microsoft, it's not just on the Bing side that they can introduce Chat GPT and kind of help jumpstart their business, but they're really going to benefit on the cloud side as well. So from an investment perspective, right now, we're finding better risk rewards in investing in the infrastructure. So it would be semiconductors, cloud infrastructure, and cybersecurity as well. So yeah, so basically, the point here is beware of value traps, right? You don't want to invest in something that will get competed away.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, definitely. And just to keep on Chat GPT, a lot of the hype has brought excitement to firms. And it kind of seems to be a similar trend to that of the crypto boom in 2021, with BuzzFeed announcing Chat GPT similar implications. Just wanted to know, do you see this as maybe a trend that will die down? Or is this something that we can expect to last?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWell ChatGPT specifically, what you will need to see is people building things that are going to be useful on it. So specifically, for us, we're looking for maybe broader opportunities than that. But AI is a trend that is definitely not going to die down. As I mentioned before, it's already a $100 billion dollar industry. So whether Chat GPT takes off or not, it’s not really going to have..it will have some implications on AI but it's not really going to have broad implications for AI, if that makes sense.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDefinitely and as you said, it is a $100 billion industry already. But in order to rev up innovation in this space further, much hardware and infrastructure will be required, such as the need for, you know, the much reliance semiconductor industry.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhat types of semiconductors, so we could just help investors understand, are required for building out AI, and how much of the industry is dedicated to its face?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYes, so, so thanks for asking that question, Connor. So basically, in order to train these models, you need GPUs. And that's why companies like Nvidia produce these today. And basically GPUs allow computers to do parallel operations and the reason why people are all of a sudden so excited about AI versus say a year or two ago is that prior to the transformer model, and prior to this language, first language models, trained AI will just be able to do prescriptive tasks. So, if you give it a bunch of images, it can learn what you're showing it, right? So it wouldn't necessarily be able to put things into context or draw its own conclusions. So in order to be able to put things into context and draw its own conclusions, the model sizes have increased exponentially. So maybe five years ago, in 2018, the model sizes would have been less than 100 million parameters. Today, these models that are trained and deployed are over over 500 billion parameters. So the amount of GPUs that are required for this is exponential.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat, and what players in the space do you see benefiting from increased demand for AI related chips such as GPUs?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e So in video is gonna be a big beneficiary full disclosure, we all not only video stock, and we disclose all of our holdings on our website, but then you may be able to see the reason why Nvidia is such a beneficiary is because they came up with this CUDA architecture that is free for people to use. So if you want to build something on AI, all you need to do is buy the NVIDIA hardware, and then you can use these frameworks for free. Other companies are not there yet. So you could still buy GPUs from AMD. But then what do you do with them? But over time, as the industry develops, there is likely going to be other solutions, and maybe some of these other companies that are developing GPUs will benefit.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnother area we really like that is not doing very well right now, is cloud infrastructure. So a lot of the cloud names are getting hit pretty hard, because of enterprise spending cuts. So this is a sector that hasn't really done that well in this recent bounce, this year. Nvidia is already up quite a bit here today, but the cloud cloud names have really not performed in line, so we like that. And then as you deploy AI, you're going to have a lot more vulnerabilities so you're going to need newer cybersecurity solutions. So this is another area where we find a lot of opportunities – basically how do you secure? How do you secure these AI workloads? And how do you secure eight edge computing?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat, so a lot of industries that are going to see some upside there and those segments, but the industry has struggled with keeping up with shift demand through supply chain constraints, severely dealing with shortages throughout the years of 2021 and 2022. If AI demand gears up in the near future, will semiconductor firms be able to manage their supply chains to keep up with demand trends?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo we see a lot of supply actually getting added over the next two to three years. So we think there is going to be plenty of supply of chips available. And just to explain how this works, basically companies like Nvidia and AMD, they don't manufacture the chips, but they just design them and then foundries like TSMC will do the actual manufacturing. So we're seeing - this is a pretty big trend actually that's supporting even broader economic activity in the U.S. are these large CapEx investments by the foundries or the large chip manufacturers like TSMC. Intel as well has expansion plans. So there's going to be plenty of supply, we believe to meet the demand.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat And just lastly, could you just break down the traditional segments of the semiconductor space? What spaces or segments do you see slowing down? And are there any other ones that you see an opportunity, and I know that you named a few, but if you just break them down for investors to understand a little bit more, I think that'd be fantastic. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, absolutely. So basically the big separation is between consumer and data center. So, if you look at, for example, TSMC, revenues would be like half consumer, like a very high level, half consumer half data center. So consumer would be used in PCs, smartphones, and then on the data center side, this would be like cloud, cloud vendors, and in any sort of enterprise computing. And then within the data center segment, we're seeing slowdown across the board. So the consumer got pretty hard hit at the beginning of last year, PC demand has been significantly down but the way semis work is usually there is a lot of inventory in the system. So what the manufacturers or designers see is a lot worse than what in demand looks like.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo as inventory stabilizes, TSMC said that they're expecting it to stabilize at the beginning of this year, and to see pick up in the second half of next year. And then similarly, on the data center side, that segment just started seeing some weakness, but we believe that the high performance computing, which is what we talked about with Nvidia, like the chips that are required for AI, we expect those will hold up better.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor Round: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat.

I'm your host Ann Barry and thrilled to join you right now. Today's guest is Kayvon Mohajer, Co-founder and CEO of SoundHound, which you guys can find under the ticker S-O-U-N. SoundHound is a voice artificial intelligence platform that helps smart devices, TVs, cars, and restaurants deliver conversational AI experiences to their customers. Kayvon it is such a pleasure to welcome you to Public Live. Thanks for joining.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eThank you for having me!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, well, let's tee this up by talking about the fact that the concept of artificial intelligence, or AI, is something that has been getting a lot of attention, particularly recently with the breakout success of open AI, chat GPT, which is something we've talked about a lot here on Public Life. We can touch on that later in the discussion if you'd like. But before we dig into artificial intelligence in general, would you mind just giving listeners a little bit of background on Soundhound and what the business does?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eSo I started three companies in undergrad and but after I graduated, I decided that I wanted to be a technical founder of a super high-tech company that would make a big impact in the world. So I went to Stanford University, and I got my Ph.D. in electrical engineering. And as I was looking for that, what would that next big change would be? I turned to science fiction, and in particular, Star Trek; I said, what do they have in stock? We don't have obvious answers like spaceships that go faster than light and teleportation and holodecks and replicators. But the one that was less obvious was voice AI. So the ability to talk to computers and robots and devices and rooms and have a natural conversation with them and ask them to do things and ask them to answer questions. And I thought that's something that would happen, for sure. And in my lifetime, and without conclusion, I started working from a dorm room at Stanford with my co-founders.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry:\u003c/strong\u003e Because science fiction does tend to become science fact over time. Right. That's, that's the old adage. So fast forward to today. Kayvon, you're out of your Stanford dorm. Talk to us about how the market for voice AI has evolved and what exactly SoundHound is doing. What does the product actually deliver?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eWe spent the first 10 years in stealth, so we kept to the secret. And we wanted to own the technology and make it better than anything else that was out there, and it took 10 years. But we finally achieved that milestone, and we unveiled it a few years ago. And today, we are one of the few companies that completely owns the full stack of voice AI and conversational AI in-house. So there are a lot of players. But most of those use a platform like ours. And we are one of the very few technology providers. And one of the unique attributes of SoundHound is that we aim really high. And we solve super complex problems that push the boundaries of what is possible. For example, what others are trying to do is they want to make computers catch up to humans in language understanding. But our goal is to make computers better than humans so they can do things that humans cannot do. And we are able to support really complex conversations. And that can make people more productive and make the world a better place. And I'll give you an example. Let's say you are looking for a restaurant and you had Chinese food yesterday. So you don't want Chinese food today. You still don't ask a personal assistant to show me restaurants except for Chinese because you don't think they will work. You kind of have learned the boundaries of where they fail and you just operate in that boundary. You ask them simple questions based on keywords. And if you do ask them to show me restaurants except for Chinese, they all say here are some Chinese restaurants where they actually give you the opposite of what you want. But without technology, you can say here's an example actually works. Today Show me Asian restaurants in San Francisco, excluding Chinese and Japanese, and only show the ones that have more than three stars and are open after 9 pm On Wednesday, and you get exactly what you want. Then you can follow up and refine it, and you have a conversation in a complex conversation. So most of our customers choose us because of our superior tech. But they also choose us because you're an independent provider of voice AI. So we don't hijack their brand, product, user, and data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eSo Keyvan, give us a really specific example of that, to bring this to life for the community. So you just gave the example where voice AI was effectively being used for search, right, that you are articulating, I want to find a restaurant with this cuisine in this area. In that example, who is your client? Is it the search engine is that the restaurant and into what device or into what platform is the user speaking to get that search result?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eSo we power devices and services. So with our cars, TVs, IoT devices, appliances, and those are the endpoints to interact with, you know, these domains. And then we also power services. So, for example, for restaurants. When was the last time you call the restaurant to place an order and you had a good experience, they usually don't pick up the phone. And when they pick up the phone, they are very distracted; it's noise in the background, and they are serving people walking in. And our solution addresses that problem. We take over their phone line; we always pick up the phone so you don't miss restaurants don't miss on any calls. And we give a really good experience for every user. We take their orders, we answer their questions, upsell people and give them recommendations. So we power products and services. And we have this ecosystem vision where we bring them together. So the services that we've voice-enabled now can be accessed by the users of products like you're driving your car, you can order food, you can book appointments, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berr: \u003c/strong\u003eGot it. I mentioned at the beginning that you do service smart devices; you've repeated them: TVs, autos, and restaurants came on to give us a sense of how big your addressable market is, how far you've penetrated it, and how much room there is left to run.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eThe voice AI category in the stock market is estimated to become 160 billion. And if you include search and monetization, you know that search is today keyword based. And Google makes a lot of money for keyword-based because people search with keywords advertisers bid on those keywords. If you include the concept that the next generation of searches conversational AI and comes from advertising, it will be much bigger than that. And there are very few providers because of the high barrier to entry. And today, we powered millions of products. The power of Vizio TVs, for example, they're the second-largest TV maker in the US. Just in the last few years, we have 17 car brands have chosen SoundHound, which is very impressive. And beyond TV and automotive, the power products like Snapchat, and Pandora, we work for companies like Netflix and MasterCard to become a robust IoT (Internet of Things) devices. We announced a strategic partnership with Qualcomm to integrate voice AI into their Snapdragon chipsets and the new Italian service fee analysis that sounds for restaurants that I just talked about.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eGreat overview. It's incredible to hear just how far SoundHoud has come from that 10 years and stealth to now having a public company out there and in full visibility. Let's talk a little bit more about AI trends more broadly came on and specifically within Voice AI. Can you talk a little bit more about AI trends more broadly came on and specifically within voice? Can you talk about whether you've seen the market for voice AI tech become a bit more crowded and how SoundHound has kept its edge and a competitive advantage?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eSo I usually, so there are a lot of players in voice because Voice AI is happening, and people are adopting it, and there's a big demand for it. But there's a high barrier to entry. So the core technology providers in voice AI, I will say, a handful at a global scale. I usually say it takes 10 years to create voice AI technologies. And it takes three years to realize it will take 10 years, so I've seen several companies with resources start on the pack and then abandon it. So there's a really high barrier to entry, and as a platinum provider in multiple languages in multiple regions, multiple industries. Soundhound is very unique. So we support about 25 languages. We support multiple industries. We are in Asia; we are in Europe, we are in North America and South America, and we claim to be the best tech. And again a lot of customers are to choose us mainly for the quality of the tech. And the fact that you're independent and we don't hijack their brand and users.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eCould you talk a little bit cable and about how voice AI benefits consumers now and maybe in the future, and just what are some of the more surprising applications that, you know, the average person doesn't really know about yet? What are the hidden nuggets of the use cases that you've seen in your experience?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eI would answer that question by explaining our three-pillar business strategy because it's very innovative. You know, we've been innovating in the tech, but we also try to be innovative in the business. And the three-pillar business strategy is the answer to that. So let me explain what that is. So in the first pillar, we power devices and products like cars, TVs, and IoT devices. There will be 75 billion IoT devices projected by 2025. So the order of magnitude is larger than smartphones. And most of these devices don't have either the physical room or economical room to add, like a touchscreen or keyboard, or mouse. But the microphone is small and inexpensive. And that's all it takes to add voice to these products. So 75 billion devices, from cars, TVs, IoT devices, and appliances, can be voice-enabled. That's our pillar one. And the business model before that is very proven, you know, we get a royalty. And then we have edge and cloud. In the second pillar, we power services, like food ordering for restaurants and customer service, and think of restaurants as what books spread on Amazon. So Amazon started by selling books. They only did that a lot of people knew Amazon as an online bookstore. And when they did that really well, they did more things. And now they sell everything from A to Z. So for restaurants, there's a very complex problem. We have a lot of focus on that now. And then we'll expand to other areas. So that would be pillar two. So pillar one, and pillar two, are very, very proven business models; they don't depend on each other success of one doesn't depend on the success of the other one. And the third pillar is when we bring them together. So we bring the services that the voice-enabled to the products that be voice-enabled. And that creates a commerce ecosystem. So while you're driving your car, you can talk to your car to control the air conditioning and the radio and navigation, then you can also order food, conveniently and from restaurants that we are both enabled. And this ecosystem benefits everyone. Users, who are the most important part of the equation, are delighted because of the convenience and speed of ordering. Restaurants are happy because they get new leads from the ecosystem. And there's a lead revenue that they share with us. And then, we share that revenue with the product leaders with that car maker with the TV maker. And they benefit as well because, in many cases, they are able to generate incremental recurring revenue for the first time from the product.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eFascinating; it's been such an interesting part of the debate around AI lately, lots of conversation, talking about how the users of these new technologies are going to have to think perhaps much differently about privacy, or bias, or other ethical topics. When it comes specifically to voice AI and everything that you've seen. What are maybe some of the challenges through that ethical or privacy-focused lens that your space faces?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eOh, yeah, so those are big challenges. And they're distinct challenges to privacy is one and bias another one. So we've seen, you know, videos and write the news when you know AI does says the wrong thing or unacceptable things undesired outcome, those happen, and the privacy's and other things like devices are always listening. So on the privacy side, that's one of the advantages that we deliver to our customers: we let them define their privacy policy and let them be as transparent as they want. And as restrictive as they want. In the way, they integrate both AI. And that's one of the disadvantages that, for example, if they get it from the big tech, they just inherit their privacy policy; whatever it is, they can't really control it. So we give flexibility to our customers. And one of the areas that can address privacy concerns is the recognition of the edge. So there's the cloud, and there's the edge so, so you're increasingly seeing both demand from our customers and our ability to run everything on the edge. So, for example, that user's voice doesn't need to leave the device, and then you can have devices that always listen without sharing your audio with third parties. On the bias. That's another challenge. And we are committed to being a pioneer in addressing those challenges. Our approach is that we combine machine learning models and software engineering algorithms to create our solutions. And the software sets the boundaries for the machine learning models. And then machine learning models are companions that make our solutions better within those boundaries that are set by our software engineers. So most of these undesired outcomes, and these are scenarios that you see in the news and other demos, are when machine learning models don't have boundaries, and then they learn from bad data, and then they have unpredictable behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eTo wrap everything together, Keyvan, what are some of the priorities that you and your team have in 2023 and beyond were the big growth opportunities that you guys are looking to lean into?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eSo the world has changed. And we are adapting and transforming to the change changes. We are transforming to be a much more financially efficient organization by reducing our costs while still growing our revenue at a very healthy rate. And our goal is to become profitable and cashflow positive within this year. We announced at the end of Q3 of the year, in quiet periods after only us will be publicly disclosed last time end of Q3 we had over $300 million of booking backlog. These are from committed customers. So we have a really solid foundation for our revenue growth with our reduced costs and increased focus. We believe we will increase our revenue growth this year, and we'll achieve our goal of becoming cash flow positive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eThese are big goals, and wishing you all the very best of luck as you pursue those.

Thank you so much for joining us. My name is Julia Rothacker. I'm the director of concierge here at Public. And we're thrilled to be with you today to talk a little bit about the reggae IPO of Shrek music royalties. Keith, would you like to introduce yourself?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHey Julia, for those who haven't met me yet? I am Keith Marshall GM of alternatives here at Public.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePerfect then let's dive straight in. Keith. I know this is a serious investment. But I'm also guessing everybody wants to hear about Shrek.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course. You know, as most of you should already know. Shrek is a bad tempered but good hearted ogre, who goes on a variety of quests in his fairy tale world. So Shrek is just a massive media franchise. It's the 17th highest-grossing film franchise of all time. And the second-highest-grossing animated film franchise which generated over $4 billion in box office sales just wild stats. And interestingly, there's actually a rumored fifth film possibly to be called Shrek Five. And you know as it's grown, the Shrek franchise has just really kept pace with streaming becoming evermore important in this media landscape. So the first two films launched on Netflix in March 2022. And were in the top 10 viewed when they were launched. Another wild stat customers watched 20.8 million Shrek and Shrek Two in the week they launched on Netflix. Those two movies have since shifted over to Peacock, which is obviously the affiliated owner of the Shrek franchise, but some are still visible on Netflix.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGreat. And now let's shift a bit to what the investment offering is here. What exactly is a royalty?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYeah, most people actually don't know what royalties are so short answer royalty interests are intellectual property. They're part of the copyright law. So really, the royalties are the actual payments. So the royalties are the payments that come to us from use of this content, the Shrek underlying content, and they're collected by what's known as performing rights organizations basically just like large clearing houses. These PRO's are what actually manage the rights on behalf of rights holders. So royalties are actual payments PRO's their job is to collect these payments from all these underlying sources of content distribution when the music from the Shrek franchise really you know the actual movies are used.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks Keith and can you explain what exactly triggers a royalty payment for FRAC?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo this catalogue generates royalties from a bunch of different sources you know, use of the tracks in the movies when the movies are streamed or sold on theme park rides there's a holiday TV special called Shrek The Halls there are even Broadway plays about Shrek all of these different things lead to royalties being generated. And you know, that's it even makes money when the movie I Am Legend plays because Will Smith's character actually watches Shrek during I Am Legend. So a significant portion of these royalty earnings have come from international sources. So this asset actually benefits from not being tied solely to the US market as well. Relatedly there are a ton of references on Reddit videos on YouTube about people actually learning English from watching Shrek, that may be one of the reasons that international viewing is and has been so strong for Shrek. But you know, of course, broadcast and streaming represent the main portion of earnings just because you know the people watching Shrek so a question that's come up a few times from people that I want to clarify. This is the score, not the soundtrack. So Smash Mouth all-star is not included. But like Fairy Tale which some of you may know from recently going viral on TikTok is included. So this is the score just the underlying orchestral music.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYes, I certainly have seen Fairy Tale a lot recently. So that gives a lot of clarity on how Our Shrek royalties work, and I am a big Shrek fan. So I love it. But this is also a an investment. Why would someone invest in royalties?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, as an attorney, we have to present a disclaimer, investors should always do their own research and understand all of these risks to consider before investing. But, you know, stepping back public's goal as a platform is to give investors tools that's investment products, and actually the education as well to build these modern diversified portfolios. And to answer your question, royalties can produce cash flow, which you know, in the current interest rate environment can definitely be appealing to investors. So in the case of the Shrek offering, any royalties received by the entity that holds these royalty interests will be paid out in the form of quarterly dividends. So royalties also benefit from being less correlated with other assets, you know, like Exchange Traded equities, because, again, they're driven by content consumption, not you know, for example, what the stock market is doing going up and down or doesn't, those things don't directly impact how people are watching Shrek and reduce correlation, cashflow. These can help investors lower portfolio volatility and hopefully increase returns on a risk-adjusted basis. So royalties are an investment tool.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks. And I understand that royalties are actually an established asset class.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYeah, so most people don't realize that this really is an investment product. And, you know, to date, institutional investors have just dominated the space is a direct example, the Michigan State employee pension funds have billions of dollars invested in music royalties, and catalogs can just sell for massive amounts, like the recent $225 million sale of Katy Perry's catalogue. You know, most people just can't participate in something like that. So with the Shrek royalties offering, investors can access royalties with as little as a $10 investment. And, you know, most of us don't have hundreds of millions to spend on a single asset, but Public wants to make these public markets actually work for all people. So this offering makes royalties more accessible to everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat makes sense. And why Shrek music within all music royalties,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eyou know, we talked about the Shrek franchise, and that's actually not the starting point for this thing. First and foremost, it's a mature asset. It has a 20-plus-year earnings history. And while we can't predict performance, you know, that means we're not relying on like how a single song by a single artist has done in the past year to assess what could happen in the next five years. It's also a strong recent historical performance, you know, earnings have actually grown in recent years due in part to streaming. We saw that last year with an earnings bump from Shrek on Netflix. And again, past performance is, of course, no guarantee of future results, but it makes our own analysis more meaningful. So comparing the 2022 calendar year earnings to the offering amount, the asset produced an eight-and-a-half percent return after fees. So it's also a life of rights interest, meaning this royalty interest is valid for the life of the composer Harry Gregson Williams plus seven years and Gregson Williams is 61 As of today. Lastly, it is Shrek we already discussed like it's an awesome media property and you know, Shrek Five could theoretically reinvigorate interest in the rest of the franchise, which could potentially increase royalty earnings. So again, Shrek Five does not yet have a release date. And recent strikes could of course, delay that, but we hope the movie is indeed forthcoming.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOkay, Keith, last question for you. How does the process work if someone wants to invest?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo the offering is $889,700 in total $10 a share, but it can be oversubscribed. So we can actually take in requests for more than the 889k. As of today, the offering is reached about 77% of its total allocation. So it really just you go in the Public app or on our site and you can request shares at the Shrek asset page. After we receive these requests for at least the total offering amount the 889,700 we will process the closing and at that point, investors will be eligible for dividends after the closing. In addition to being eligible for these dividends, investors can participate in a secondary market, meaning they can buy and sell shares from one another on the Public platform. And I want to close out with a reminder that dividend payments aren't guaranteed. They depend directly on the consumption of Shrek to keep generating royalties. So, always do your own research.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAbsolutely.

I'm your host Kinsey Grant and today's show is brought to you by Gambling Group. Joining us today, we have a fantastic guest, David Rumsey, the journalist at Front Office Sports, and in this role covers the influence of sports on business and culture. He also co-authors a newsletter for Front Office Sports, and we have a ton to cover today because it has been a very wild summer in one specific aspect of the sports world that we're going to get into in a lot of depth and detail today that I'm personally really excited about. I've tried to follow this a little more than in recent years. We're going to talk about soccer and the influence of soccer on the U.S., on the sports entertainment business in the United States, how the United States' appetite for soccer is changing, and what that means for all of you investors out there listening. So, David, thank you so much for being here today. I really appreciate you joining us on Public.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDavid Rumsey: \u003c/strong\u003eThanks Kinsey, it's fun to be here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, for sure. So like I mentioned, you know, I think just to kind of kick things off, it's probably best to start with something that you and I are sure to agree on here, that in comparison, especially to the rest of the world, the United States is pretty famously not into soccer as a lot of the rest of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDR: \u003c/strong\u003eAbsolutely.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYou know, we maybe just don't appreciate it as much. Maybe we just have other bigger competitors like, you know, American football or basketball or any other sport. But I'd love to hear a little bit of your perspective on why you think the United States has been kind of slow to adopt soccer as, you know, one of our favorite pastimes to watch on TV, on streamers. Tell me a little bit more about how that appetite is changing and why it had to kind of change in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDR: \u003c/strong\u003eRight. We could have a whole other podcast discussion on the history of soccer in the world, in the U S and why baseball and football, and basketball might be more popular. But I think everybody, like you're saying, realizes soccer is maybe kind of the fourth or fifth most popular sport in the U S and it has been for some time. But to your point, it's growing and the women's world cup is going on right now. We had the men's world cup last year and when those big 10 pole events come up, America really gets behind their national soccer teams and MLS is growing. I know we're going to hit on Messi coming to the United States at Inter Miami. So there's an appetite there and even fans becoming more interested in European soccer, whether it's the Premier League, Champions League, Barcelona and LaLiga. Soccer players are global superstars, the men and the women. And I think that's really appealing to sports fans in the U.S.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, I think we, you know, we'll get into the Messi stuff for sure. But to the point that this, this is a sport that's largely dominated by the superstar kind of athletes, I think is something that's really interesting. I mean, obviously in the United States, in other sports, we've shown a ton of appetite for these superstar athletes, whether it's, you know, Derek Jeter or Tom Brady, or, you know, any of the famous U S women's gymnasts that we have loved to follow. I think that we can really relate to and resonate with that kind of superstar power when it comes to a sport. So with that in mind, knowing that we are talking a lot more about the stars on the US women's national team, about stars like Messi, do we think, do you think that we as the United States are going to at any point put soccer on the same kind of league that we would, or the same level that we would, like the NFL or the NBA, do you see that ever becoming a possibility just to set the stage before we get into some of the details of why we're talking about soccer more today?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDR: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, that's certainly what MLS would like to see happen, right? They want to become not just a top league in the U S but they want to be seen as a top-five soccer league in the world. Keep in mind, there are so many other soccer leagues. Every country has a big domestic soccer league and you rank them across the world. So MLS is goal is to be seen on a global stage, um, you know, top tier up with Premier :eague, some of the top European leagues. So that's their long-term goal. And of course to do that, they're going to need to grow in the US. I think they've been seen as the fifth most popular sport behind, of course, football, basketball, baseball, and hockey. I think an argument could be made that they're gaining some ground. But if you look at their media deal right now with Apple, it's 10 years, $250 million a year. That's, that's a lot less than the billions and billions. The other leagues are bringing in, particularly the NFL and NBA. So on an annual basis, it's going to take some time, but of course you have the men's World Cup coming here in 2026 and everybody in soccer in the US is really banking on that event to play up the interest for fans and make money off of it every way that they can.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, absolutely. And it's, I think, an important point to note here, just the scale of what we're talking about here when 250 million is kind of small potatoes compared to some of these major, major deals. Like I really don't think that we can, you know, over-communicate the influence and the size and scale of some of these deals with streaming services, with broadcasters for the broadcasting rights to major sports in the United States. It's, it's a big business, I think, to say the least.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDR: \u003c/strong\u003eRight.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eBut to your point, a lot of this big business revolves around more tent pole events. Like you were talking about the Men's World Cup last year and in 2026. And this summer talking a lot about the Women's World Cup. I think that it's very difficult to have a conversation about how soccer is growing in terms of influence in the United States without talking about the women's national team. They have been certainly a record-breaking and attention-grabbing team for many years now, but this summer especially we're talking a ton about women playing soccer because of the Women's World Cup, because of people like Abby Wambach and Megan Rapinoe and all of these household names. Can you tell me a little bit more about how the women's national team has influenced soccer as a sport?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDR:\u003c/strong\u003e For sure. I think they've really given America some juice on a global stage because frankly, when we look at our men's team, we're just not up there with the other countries in the world from Europe, from South America. When we get to the Men's World Cup, we'll maybe make it out of the group stage and then usually lose in the first round of the knockout stage. And the women's team is the complete opposite. You know, it's a given that we're going to make it out of each group stage, back-to-back World Cup champions on the women's side. So I think that shows the U.S. can be a powerhouse, right? Because we're giving all these resources to our women's team. And that's a whole nother issue that maybe other countries aren't devoting as many funds to their women's teams as their men's teams. But we are here in the U.S. and that's given us four World Cup titles on the women's side and been a real leader in the space. And I think you see the fans get behind it. I mean, the viewership is there. The second group stage game in this Women's World Cup set a record viewership on Fox for the group stage in a Women's World Cup. So the interest is there, the players are there, but the world is catching up a little bit in terms of funding their women's teams more. And this World Cup, I think, is showing some fierce competition. So it's not gonna be a cakewalk for the women's team.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eSo let's talk about how these teams are funded. Obviously here in the United States, what the women's national team gets paid has been a major topic of conversation for even casual sports fans. If I, as somebody who doesn't know a ton about soccer, know about this fight for better pay that the women's team has been fighting for a long time now, I think it's safe to say a lot of people who are just casual sports fans also know about it. So... let's talk about kind of where that money is coming from. What is the business kind of state of play in soccer in the United States right now? Can you give me kind of a lay of the land of how the money's made, where the money is spent, sort of what's going on in terms of soccer in the U.S. as a business?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDR:\u003c/strong\u003e From a very 30,000-foot view, you have US Soccer, which is the governing body of soccer here in the United States of America. And they manage the Men's National Team, the Women's National Team, all the other junior teams, under-21 teams, all the way down into youth participation in soccer on a kids' level. So their job is a lot more than building a World Cup champion on the men's or women's side. Yes, that's part of it. And we want to compete on a global stage, but US Soccer. brings in all this money to fund soccer participation around the country, right? So they want as many kids playing soccer right now when they're six, seven years old. And two decades from now, maybe they'll be the next Megan Rapinoe, right? Or Christian Pulisic. So they get a lot of money from media rights. FIFA sells rights to the World Cup, and that brings in billions and billions of dollars. It can get a little complicated in the most recent deals on the US side. Fox was able to buy the World Cup rights for the men's and the women's through 2026. And we know that FIFA has had some corruption scandals in the past, and it's not necessarily a clean business there. But they bring in those media rights and then they distribute it back to the governing bodies around the world, U.S. Soccer being one of them. And then they allocate how they see fit based on the performance. And that's why. the women's national team has been fighting for equal pay there on that side. They're saying, you know, hey, we're winning World Cups. The men aren't performing. Why aren't we getting, you know, the same amount if not more? So that's a big argument, obviously, but that's media is a big reason these teams and the U.S. soccer gets paid money. So that's where a lot of the funding comes from.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and you know, it's hard to have a conversation around media and soccer without talking about Lionel Messi. Obviously, this has been just an enormous story in the soccer world, also in the business world, talking about how he negotiated this deal, how his team brokered this deal to come play in America. I know you've covered it extensively. Can you tell me a little bit about Messi's influence, broadly speaking, on soccer as a game, but also soccer as a business?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDR: \u003c/strong\u003eSure. Well, I just know personally, I've had friends who became fans of soccer because of Messi, watching him play for Argentina on a global stage, watching him play at his Barcelona days in European soccer. And back when I wasn't as much of a fan of soccer, Messi was still one of those names that I knew. Ronaldo was a name that everybody knew, even if you weren't a soccer fan. They were some of the most popular athletes in the world alongside LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Tom Brady, and Peyton Manning here in the US at least. Messi is just he's global and he's still you know, he might not be at the peak of his elite powers now, but he still won the World Cup last year and was the most valuable player there last summer and he came to Inter Miami and it's stoking just huge amounts of excitement among American fans and bringing more attention globally to the MLS.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd tell me a little bit about what this deal is that Messi struck with Inter Miami. What are some of the bigger contours of the deal that make it something that's striking enough to kind of gain national attention?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDR: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, MLS is different than a league like the NFL or NBA that has a hard salary cap and you can only pay players a certain amount and you have to spread it out over equally over the players pretty much. In MLS, you can have designated players where their salaries don't count towards the salary cap because there are financial structures in place to limit the spending of these teams because... Frankly, they don't have as much money to spend. As we talked about, only $250 million of media rights coming in per year compared with 10 billion for the NFL. There's not as much money to go around, but I bring that up because when you have a player like Messi, he comes in, he's bigger than the team. Everybody would say that. So he can be a designated player and get paid in different ways. So Inter Miami knows that. they're going to get a lot, a lot of revenue from Messi coming in, whether it's Jersey sales, ticket sales. Messi actually brokered a deal with Apple reportedly to receive some equity of season ticket, uh, um, signups to the MLS season pass subscription service because Apple said, you know what? We know people are going to pay more and be more interested in our service. If Messi is here. So they were willing to give him a cut of their proceeds basically to help him lure him to MLS. So it's a very interesting deal between his salary, between an ownership stake potentially with his club, Inter Miami after his playing days, some incentives from Apple, some reported incentives from Adidas on the Jersey supply side. So he could be making well north of a hundred million dollars a year. And, you know, a typical MLS player is lucky to be breaking, you know, a few million.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's really incredible to, again, recognize just the scale of some of these deals and the scope of some of them. Certainly something interesting as, again, a casual sports fan, but also somebody who loves to understand more about these incentive structures in the business world and especially in media. This is just a really interesting story to watch unfold. So I'm excited to kind of continue to keep an eye on it. And with that, as we close out our conversation here, David, I would love to hear a little bit of your perspective on just big-picture thinking and things that you're expecting, expectations from soccer in the next couple of years, knowing that we do have some of these big stories on the horizon, like we talked about today with Messi, with the US Women's National Team. What are you expecting from soccer as a sport and soccer as a business in the coming years? Tell me a little bit more about your expectations for the future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDR:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I think right now, this summer, I'm interested to see if the U.S. Women's National Team can get a third straight World Cup title and what they would be able to do from a marketing perspective and investment perspective of saying we're really the dominant force in global soccer on the women's side to keep propelling their fight for equal pay and pushing those stars that you have the National Women's Soccer League in the U.S. So certainly that's going to keep. a World Cup victory would keep propelling that, you know, our domestic league here in the US. But beyond that, you know, I think it's coming up in 2026 is the Men's World Cup is going to be in North America. So primarily in the US, but also in Canada and Mexico, it's a joint bid. All three of those countries are going to be hosting the World Cup. And it's just going to be huge. In 1994, the US hosted the World Cup. And that's kind of what kicked off Major League Soccer in the US. And that was kind of FIFA wanted to wake up the American fan base and it's worked. It's a slow burn. Obviously, we've been talking about how MLS is not quite on the level of NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL. But everybody in soccer is just so bullish on the men's World Cup coming here in 2026. And then, by the way, the US is bidding to host the women's World Cup the year after that in 2027. So it's just going to be. so much opportunity if they were to get that on the heels of the men's World Cup. There's nothing like a kid being able to go to a World Cup game. Yes, it's fun to go to an MLS game or a Premier League friendly that might be playing at a football stadium during the summer. But being able to see the World Cup and just kind of the stature of that, that's going to stoke so much excitement. And it's a long-term play, obviously. You know, if you're a kid, 10 years old, you become a fan of soccer. It's You're not going to make an impact if you become a player for, you know, at least a decade. But that's what everyone is bullish on. And, of course, the commercial financial opportunities. Fox is going to be broadcasting that World Cup, but all these NFL stadiums will be hosting games. It's not decided yet where the World Cup final will be taking place. Of course, New York wants to host it. Los Angeles wants to host it, maybe even Dallas. So there's everybody wants a piece of the pie, and they want to capitalize on that. So any time. You see a new venue being built. You see somebody investing in a soccer team. They're always citing the World Cup in 2026. That's the inflection point. And then beyond that, it's going to be up to the soccer stakeholders in the U S to capitalize on that and bring in the most interest in the sport as they can beyond that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, absolutely. All right. Well, David, what a way to end this conversation, I think, to look ahead to understand where we might go next is always super interesting. I'm eager to watch how, you know, 2026 and 2027 potentially play out. I think this could be another interesting conversation to keep track of as a sports fan, and as an investor. So, David Rumsey, thank you so much for joining us today on Public. I appreciate your time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDR: \u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely, thanks for having me on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eOf course.

I'm your host, Kinsey Grant and I am so excited to be here with you today. This episode is going to be super informative. We have a stellar guest here to talk about online gambling and sports betting and earnings headed right your way right now, Charles Gillespie is Chief Executive Officer, Co-founder and a Director at Gambling.com Group. That's the ticker G-A-M-B. Gambling.com Group is a leading provider of digital marketing services for the global online gambling industry and was founded in 2006. Charles. Welcome to Public, how's it going?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCharles Gillespie: \u003c/strong\u003eThings are going very well. Thanks for having me on, look forward to sharing our great story with your audience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I'm excited to hear this story and I think that framing it as a story is really the way to start here. So let's hear a little bit about the beginning of the story. If you will, I want to hear more about your company. Do you mind giving me just a brief overview of your business model?Tell me a little bit about how your business works.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, sure, no problem. So, what we do for the online gambling industry is basically the same thing that, say Hotels.com does for hotels. So if you wanna go to Paris, you're not gonna go to 10 different Parisian hotel websites to find a hotel or you're gonna go to hotels dot com or booking dot com or something like that and get all the information in one place and make a decision there. So, we basically do the same thing for the online gambling industry. So if you're gonna bet on sports and you're in, let's say Massachusetts, (just because Massachusetts just launched sports betting) there are a great many different places you could play at, online in Massachusetts, which are now legal and regulated. And, it, you know, our typical users that go to Google, they search for something like top Massachusetts sports books, they'll find one or more of our websites: we've got betmassachusetts.com, we've also got gambling.com, bookies.com and a lot of other sites, they'll find one of our sites, they'll find the information they're looking for. So, you know, top 10 sports books in, in Massachusetts and then they'll click and leave one of our websites, go to one of those sports books, register deposit play. And then we get paid, and, and what we do is called performance marketing because we only get paid when the traffic we send to these, online gambling companies performs when they actually sign up deposit in play. And if they don't, we don't get paid anything. And that's the the nature of the performance marketing model.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eSo tell me a little bit about, you know, the, the bigger picture that's going on here and we'll get into earnings in a second. But I imagine it's been quite a, a transformative time and, you know, momentous several years for, for your business and for working in the space in which you work with the advent of, of legal gambling and legal, online gambling and sports betting in all, all sorts of different states. Tell me a little bit more about how you view that momentum's impact on your business.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it really has been a, a hell of a couple of years, but we started this all the way back in 2006. Myself and, and the COO we both went to UNC, we're both from North Carolina. And, we wanted to start a legal and proper business in the online gambling industry, even all the way back in 2006. And back then, there was no legal online gambling in the United States. So we left, and we ended up building this business in Europe. Our largest office has been in Ireland for a number of years. Our largest market has been the UK, for most of the history of the company. And, then in 2018, when the Supreme Court unblocked sports betting, across the US, we had to turn the ship around and point it back at the US and, and really kind of come full circle. So, we've seen this industry grow and grow and grow and we understand how early it still is in the US and kind of North American regulated online gambling market. You know, a lot of people look at New Jersey, which has had, online casino gaming for nearly 10 years. And sports betting for, you know, five years and they think that it's, it's done or it's mature or that, you know, everyone's already signed up for all the, all the online sports books already and there's kind of, you know, it's not gonna grow and, and we know that that's not the case. You know, we've seen big markets like the UK Ireland, even Sweden, Italy, you know, just grow and grow and grow, you know, 20 years after, they first regulated. So we see an incredible situation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eRight. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eYou've got this, this industry which is high margin, high growth and booming all around the world, which basically did not exist in the United States for regulatory reasons. And then the doors have just been kind of flung open in 2018. And now you've got a majority of states with regulated sports betting. You got a handful of states with online casino and more are gonna come every single year. so you, you've taken, you're going from this situation where regulated online gambling in the United States was sub a billion. And, I don't even know what the latest figures are because it changes so quickly. But, you know, it's, I don't know, it's, you know, estimates are 40 or 50 billion in, in, you know, another five or 10 years, which is crazy. I mean, it, you can, it's impossible to think of another, industry where you've gone from sub a billion to 50 billion in the space of, you know, 10 or 15 years. So it, it really is an incredibly exciting industry. We do love this industry and, we're very happy to, to be bringing this business back to the United States. And of course, we did the IP O in 2021 which was, you know, we got the picture on the, on the wall behind me here. That's, that was clearly one of the big, one of the big days in our history.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I, I can imagine there is a, a ton of excitement and it seems to be a theme, you know, with all this momentum in mind, I want to talk about earnings. You reported earnings late last week, tell me what are three things you would want investors to take away from your most recent earnings report.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eKind of three big lessons. So uniquely within the online gambling industry or at least within the publicly traded companies in the United States that focus on this sector. You know, basically, all of them are high growth but, but very few of them are profitable and very few of them are very profitable and we are both high growth and highly profitable. So, year-on-year growth in the quarter was 36%. Virtually all of that was organic growth. There was a tiny contribution from one month of an acquisition. But, you know, then we also had adjusted margin at 40% and free cash flow of over six million, you know, so we actually make money, you know, in, in, in kind of sharp contrast to a number of the more high profile names in the sector. Which obviously gets a lot of attention. And, and because of that, I think it's, it's, really a unique business. But, the thing I'd, I'd also call out is, look, we grew 33% year on year in North America.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eOk.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd that's against Q one last year, which had the monumental launch of sports betting in New York State, which, you know, I'm sure there's more than a few people listening to this from New York you know, the finance community there is, is great and very into sports betting and it was kind of all the rage in, in Q one last year and, and obviously that drove great results for us a year ago. And despite that kind of blowout number, those blowout numbers in North America a year ago, we still grew 33% year on year in North America, this Q one. But on the other side of the Atlantic and our other kind of main segment in the UK and Ireland, we actually grew 36% year on year, which is even faster than North America, which, again gets back to this idea that this industry keeps growing for a very long time, you know, they regulated online gambling in, in the UK in about 2005. And it, you know, and it, the industry is still growing the affiliates, you know, companies like us performance marketing companies, they're continuing to occupy a kind of bigger and bigger part of the player acquisition within the whole sector. And companies like ours are continuing to take market share within the affiliate performance marketing space. So, you know, to me it's, it's, it's really surprising that we grew even faster in the UK and Ireland, than North America. But, you know, they're both high growth and, and that's perfectly fine.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I think that this, this hint at this larger idea that, you know, you, you started this conversation with the story of your company, the story of this industry. I'm curious about whether this last quarter one that you, you know, just reported earnings for, does this impact the bigger picture story for your company at all? Does this change anything for you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eI think Q one was, it was like it was a record quarter. But, you know, as a high-growth company, most quarters are supposed to be record quarters. So I think, you know, there wasn't any strategy shift or any sort of, I, I think, I think what was a remark about the quarter was just, it's, the fantastic numbers with us just focusing on the business. You know, there was no acquisitions, there was no, nothing out unexpected, nothing out of the ordinary and, and, and we still drove as strong of a performance as we did.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, totally. So, with all of that in mind, I wanna understand a little bit more about the future and hear your perspective on the future. So we'll take a second here to kind of pivot to look ahead. Tell me a little bit about the rest of this year. What are your priorities look like as a company through the rest of 2023?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eGenerally speaking in North America, we focus on, a couple of things. So new state launches are very important for us and we had a number of new state launches last year. This year, they're, we're not expecting to have any new states launch before the end of the year. And that's, you know, that's a very helpful tailwind. But despite that, you know, we've put out very, healthy guidance at the beginning of the year and we've already raised that guidance on the back of the Q one report that we had put out, last week. So, you know, even without new state launches, we're targeting revenue of, 90 where let me make sure I give you the exact, the right numbers here, the, the, the 95 to 99 million, you know, so, knocking on the door of 100 million this year.  And, if we do get any new state launches, you know, because Kentucky is regulated, you know, North Carolina, is probably going to regulate, you know, do the legislation in the next kind of 23 weeks. We're very positive on North Carolina, it's an important state for us. And when those states after they legislate, then they actually need to publish a timeline to launch. And once we have clarity on that, we will add it to the guidance because there's nothing in the guidance now about new state launches. So when we know North Carolina is going live, when we know Kentucky is going live, then we'll, we'll be able to, to tell the market and, and adjust. But the other thing I really, have people think about, and what we are really focused on for the remainder of this year is our new media partnership with Gannet. So Gannet is the largest publisher of daily newspapers in the United States. They publish USA Today, you know, which is the only kind of truly non-business national newspaper in the United States, with a very good sports section. And we have partnered with Gannet to help them monetize sports betting. They know that they've got a huge opportunity with all these different digital media properties of theirs and this great big audience and they came to us to help them, maximize the opportunity and, and, and basically make money off of this industry. If you look at it from our perspective, you know, when we try to grow the business, we can, we can add content to the websites. We already have, we can build new websites, we can buy websites or we can partner with websites and, and that's what we've done with t so, now if you go to USA Today.com/betting, you'll see our content. So that's all us. We've built, you know, essentially this kind of mini site of sports betting information and, and we, you know, pipe that into USAtoday.com and that should be a pretty meaningful driver of revenue, into the end of the year, especially after the start of NFL. So, as you can imagine, the start of the NFL season is really the kind of coming out party, for, for sports betting, every year. You know, it's a, it's a time of the year when, people set up a lot of new accounts, people obviously bet on the NFL more than they bet on anything else. And, you know, being in position at the beginning of the autumn sports season is very important for all sports betting companies, including ourselves. So, we expect to be in a good place in September for that autumn season.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, certainly, very interesting. And we'll, we'll have to check back in, in September too and I've got one last question for you here, Charles; you've talked a bit here about, you know, the, the bigger story, the broader industry trends and contours that are, are driving gambling as an industry right now, sports betting as an industry right now, I'm curious to hear your perspective on when, if at all, there is a tipping point, you know, you mentioned that the growth you're, you're seeing in Europe, in the UK and Ireland is still significant and still in some ways surprisingly significant, right? But I'm curious about if, you know, there's a point at which that growth might begin to slow down for the industry writ large. Tell me a little bit more about what that might look like if you think that might even come to fruition at all. What do you think the longer-term picture for the industry looks like?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, I think, I think the growth, you know, by definition has to slow, but, you know, the question is really by how much, you know, and, and you know, how, how many years do we have left while it's still high growth? I.e.; more than kind of 30 plus percent a year. And I would think we've got probably, you know, at least a decade plus, possibly more. You know, not every state has regulated sports betting. Very few states have regulated online casino. And frankly, you know, it's just like a land-based, casino. You know, if you look at the size of the slots and you look at the size of the sports book, there'll be about, you know, 10 times as much space given to the slots. And that's because that's where the money is at. Sports betting is actually kind of a low-margin business. And, and in many, you know, a lot of people in the industry look at it as kind of, a player acquisition tool. It's a way to get someone through the door and then hopefully they stop and play some blackjack or, you know, some slots, which is a, a product in the casino which is a higher margin product. So I think, you know, you've got an enormous amount of regulatory progress left to be made, which, which I think will be made. online casino is a little bit of a tougher sell for some of these legislatures as you can imagine, but it wasn't so long ago that sports betting was inconceivable in, in so many of these states. So, you know, the, there's a kind of 50 plus 60 70 years plus, timeline of, increasingly regulating gambling in the United States and, and online is just kind of the latest, manifestation of that. So, we don't think there's any lack of, of momentum in, in the regulatory, from the regulatory standpoint. And as we, you know, get through the next couple of years, you'll get a couple of online casino states a couple more. And that will really seriously move the needle in addition to some more sports betting states, but even the existing states will grow. You know, there's, there's this kind of surge of interest when the state launches because you have all this pent-up demand which comes to market, and then things settle down. and, but once they settle down, then they grow consistently, you know, for, for, you know, probably 10 plus years. And that gives, you know, you look at the New Jersey numbers, they've had, you know, they've been doing this kind of longer than anyone and the numbers are, are fantastic and still growing. So, you know, it's, it's, and, and to very briefly touch on, you know, all things not North America, you know, this is a global industry, there's a lot of money being made around the world in this industry and it's not just English speaking markets, like, you know, the US, Canada, UK, and Ireland, you know, you've got Japan, which is probably gonna come online in the next, you know, a couple of years in a, in a legal way. You've got Brazil, which is regulating, you know, there's, there's a lot of, you know, practically every market in Europe is, is still growing, and, and, you know, profitable and, and, and very nice business for the online gambling operators. You know, our clients, as well as the online gambling affiliates, you know, performance marketing companies like ourselves. So, you know, everybody seems to focus on the US because, you know, we're listed in the US. Our investors are mainly in the US. Of course, it's kind of front of mind for them. But the amount of opportunity outside the US is, is easily as compelling as, as the US opportunity itself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, certainly very interesting to keep in mind and I appreciate the big picture thinking and the broad context here, Charles, this has been such a, a wonderful conversation.\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eI really appreciate you taking the time sharing more about the story of your company and your recent earnings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's, it's been wonderful.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eSo thank you so much for coming by.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCG: \u003c/strong\u003eMy pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eOf course and wanna once again, want to thank our guest Charles Gillespie, Chief Executive Officer, Co-founder, and a Director at Gambling.com Group.

I'm your host Kinsey Grant. Today's show is brought to you by SinglePoint, a renewable energy and sustainable lifestyle company. And I'm so excited to welcome our guests, which I will do in just a minute, to give you a quick heads up on what we're gonna be talking about today. We have some major big time investing themes coming at you in today's edition of the Public Podcast. We're talking solar as a category within the renewable sector, which is obviously very interesting to, I'm sure, tons of you who are listening to this right now. We're gonna be talking about what solar means for the broader renewable sector, about some of the companies that make up the solar value chain. We're gonna be talking about the Inflation Reduction Act. And of course, throughout all of this, the ways that you as investors can potentially add this theme to your portfolio and hopefully learn a lot. So to do all of that, I'm super excited to welcome our wonderful guest today. Rene Reyna, the Head of Thematic ETF Product Strategy at Invesco. Rene, welcome to Public Live.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRene Reyna:\u003c/strong\u003e Hi Kinsey, great to be here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, super excited to jump in today. We have, like I mentioned, a lot to cover. So if you're ready, we'll get right into it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRene Reyna: \u003c/strong\u003eWorks for me. I'm excited.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eAll right, me too, me too. Okay, so Rene, I wanna start here with kind of the big picture. We are definitely going to get into the Inflation Reduction Act stuff, which has obviously been a huge moment for renewables as a sector. We'll get to that during this conversation, but before we get there, I would love to talk about solar as it fits into renewables as a broader sector in investing in the economy. Tell me a little bit about how solar is tracking within the renewable sector right now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRene Reyna: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, sure. So, you know, if it's okay, maybe just take a step back and, you know, just think of renewables or clean energy in the sense of this energy transition that's taking place. And so, you know, I think we all recognize what are the drivers there. So one, you got climate change. You know, the science does demonstrate that the burning of fossil fuel does have a major impact to the air we breathe, right? And so there's the negative impacts associated with the environment. There's negative impacts associated with human health. And then there's the economic impacts that are also a result of some of this climate change. So I think of clean energy, renewable sort of along the sustainability sort of opportunity set, if you will. I think secondly, there's energy security we need to think about. So, you know, the less reliance we have on energy imports, you know, think of the power OPEC has and how that impacts the average consumer, you know, I think renewables can help solve for that. And then there's economic benefits. I mean, if we think about job creation as a result of some of these new transitions that are taking place, the new technology, if you will, and then also the lower energy costs as we create more scale along some of the renewable sources. So it really is exciting what's taking place, renewables. If I look at solar specifically, you know, it's just one important part of the sort of renewable puzzle. And so I think of solar in the context of what are the other renewable energy sources. So, generally speaking, you think about wind, you think about hydro, you think about biomass, and geothermal, and collectively renewables are surpassing US electric generation. For example, we passed nuclear in 2021, we passed coal-fired generation in 2022. So renewables are really having a meaningful impact. The US renewables represent 21, 22% of US electricity generation. Solar is about 3.5% of that, which goes to the question. So solar, as a part of this renewable puzzle, if you will, it is a, it's unique and it's very important. It's widely available, easy to deploy. So we think about the sun as a resource. Clearly, it's a resource that we have available day in and day out. It could be easily installed, so it's flexible. So think about installing rooftops, large solar farms, as an example. I think what's unique about solar, from an investment perspective, is cost. And so if we think about from 2010 to about 2020, we've seen costs of solar installs come down. Now, it hasn't been just a straight line downward. We've seen some pressures and increase in costs the last couple of years. But that in itself, if you think about some of the trade-offs, we go back to early 2000s, a lot of consumers, for example, were not doing the math and saying, hey, what is the breakeven if I want to install a solar panel in my home? And generally, it was about 20 years. And then you fast forward to today, and that breakeven. In a single digit of years. And again, there's a lot of other factors that can go into that. But clearly there's been a lot of advancements. So I think that makes soil unique. The economic benefits and job creation, which I mentioned earlier, if we think about solar jobs in comparison to oil extraction, coal mining, there's actually more US jobs in solar production than there are in those two categories, which I don't think many people realize. So there is this economic benefit. And sort of the last component I think about solar, and I know this is a long answer, so I apologize, but the innovation, the technology around solar. If I think of the solar plus storage, for example, Renova, which is one of the holdings in one of our ETFs, partners with Tesla's Powerwall for installs. The solar battery storage went from saving approximately six minutes worth of energy up to about 10 hours plus today. And so those are some of the factors that I think make solar exciting if I think about renewable energy more broadly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's a phenomenal way to get started with this conversation. I think that established a ton of the important context that we need to understand why solar and renewables, more broadly speaking, have become a theme that investors might be gravitating toward. And later in the conversation, I do want to make sure we hit on that element of how investors might be able to add solar as a theme to their investing portfolio and to their investing strategy. But even before we get there. I would love to dig in a little bit more to the nitty gritty of the renewable sector, particularly solar. When we're talking about the energy value chain, the solar energy value chain, I'm curious about what has made it such that those prices have come down. We're talking obviously about a lot of different moving parts and elements that come together to create solar as a part of the renewable sector. But I'm curious to hear a little bit more about the industries or the sub-industries that might be contributing to this wider proliferation of solar energy as part of the renewables landscape. What are those elements that are coming together to make solar a more affordable or more accessible option right now?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRene Reyna:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, so I think in the general sense, or in these terms, is increased utilization, increased technology. And that scalability has helped bring down costs if I think of the solar value chain Specifically, so you know generally the components are you have sort of the production side insulation side you have financing then you have kind of ongoing maintenance and When you think of it from you know, just breaking down some of these segments. So the first component is upstream, so think polysilicon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant:\u003c/strong\u003e Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRene Reyna:\u003c/strong\u003e You know, DocuNew Energy and GCL Technologies, who are the largest players in this space, those polysilicon costs have come down quite a bit. And these materials are used for kind of that midstream area where we think about solar panel manufacturers. So, you know, solar panels are made up of PV cells. They convert sunlight into electricity. So you have solar wafers, solar cells, and solar modules. The companies that played this there would be like Cinco Solar Canadian solar United renewables These are sort of your midstream players. This also includes inverter Manufacture so you have to at some point convert your son into your DC to AC back to DC and so these inverters are Inverse using manufacturers. So think of like the end phases of the world solar edge. These would be considered kind of that midstream category. And then from there, you kind of go downstream. So now start thinking about installers, distributors, some of the utility companies. And Cavus is a big solar utility company. No far energy, if I think about like installations and building out of some of these solar farms, they're a big company in this space. So globally, this sets up sort of this value chain. And so as more commitments to increasing solar utilization, increasing capacity, that has over time driven down cost. When we look at sort of the space and say, well, who are some of the bigger suppliers that are helping, you know, reduce some of these costs? You know, China is the biggest manufacturer when it comes to solar manufacturing, solar parts. And so it's really some of their scale. We looked at China economically a lot for lower manufacturing costs. But collectively, that has brought down some of the costs. And so demand is growing not only in China, it's growing in Europe, it's growing in the US. So all these countries and corporations, for that matter, who are making commitments to reduce their carbon emissions, is all contributing to the scale and that's ultimately bringing down some of those costs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, certainly, it certainly makes a lot of sense. And I think this idea of the way that renewables are scaling and solar specifically are scaling right now certainly makes a compelling case for why this cost might be decreasing. This utilization has really picked up and we have reason to believe that it might continue to pick up because of news that has come from DC, from certain industry, but very much DC over the last year or so. I think this is a great segue to talk about the Inflation Reduction Act, which was passed last year, made some pretty landmark provisions for clean energy. I would love to hear your perspective on how the Inflation Reduction Act, commonly referred to as the IRA, how that might've impacted solar. Tell me a little bit more about what the impact has been from that legislation on the solar space. So, I'm gonna go ahead and start with the solar. So, I'm gonna start with the solar.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRene Reyna: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so it was huge, in my opinion. You know, I think it just speaks to our commitment, which globally, I think there was some concern. So, you know, not to get into the politics of it, but, you know, it's kind of goes to the timeline. You know, there was a transition from President Trump to President Biden. You know, almost immediately he rejoins the Paris Accord. And so this is sort of the global commitment to reduce, you know, carbon emissions. And then he also had his legislation that ultimately got passed, the Inflation Reduction Act, and it resulted in the largest climate-related bill ever. So $369 billion in spending and green energy tax credits were a result of the IRA. And so in some cases, it extended some tax credits that are already exist. Some listeners maybe heard of the Energy Policy Act that was created back in 2005. And so there were already some subsidies or tax credits that were in place that were sort of being reduced over time. And so this sort of reignited those tax credits, extended them for another 10 years, increased some of those tax credits up to 30%. And so this really helps stimulate this marketplace. And so if I think some of the impact of the IRA specifically, you heard me talk a lot about reducing carbon emissions. So I think this sort of fast tracks the US a little bit. There are various studies out there. I think some of what I read was perhaps it increases our speed by 40 percent in terms of hitting some of these targets by 2030. So I think that was impactful. I think also there were parts of the IRA that included tax credits for production. So there's been a lot of talk, I think we've heard in the news, around on-shoring, so reducing our reliance on other countries and their production. So there was a lot of supply chain issues, for example, that delayed and increased costs recently. And so these new incentives should and actually are enticing companies to produce and manufacture here in the US. So again, I talked about some of the economic benefits around job creation. So that's a positive. And we've seen some of the largest manufacturers. So First Solar, A Solar, you know, they've all committed already to manufacture here in the US. So, you know, this should serve as a stimulus really to this transition. Now again, I think we have to acknowledge the environment we're in today. You know, we have a high inflation and interest rate environment. So we are seeing a little bit of maybe not the quick acceleration that we would like. And I think a lot of it is because now you have consumers, businesses have to make decisions around investments due to the inflation and trade environment. But nonetheless, over the long term, this is viewed as net positive. And I think the one thing I'll say too, and I hope, I just want to emphasize that, because the costs have come down so significantly, because corporations and countries are committing to reducing their carbon emissions, I look at some of these subsidies and incentives as really icing on the cake. And so in other words, I think we were kind of going down this path already, and now you have some, let's call it longer commitments in terms of the US with these tax credits that should help maybe move some of those that were on the fence a little bit about making that commitment, sort of bring them over the line, if you will. So I think it's really exciting and we should see increased solar production as well as solar utilization here in the US over the next few years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's a great kind of big picture, 30,000 foot view of what's going on in solar. And it's certainly helpful to hear the context in the background around how this very much talked about legislation is actually going to come to fruition with the economic realities that we're all facing today. So now that we have gotten that big picture, that kind of zoom out view of what's going on in solar, I would love to talk a little bit about the more micro, how can investors who are listening to this, include solar in their portfolios as a theme, knowing what we know now about the impacts of the global value chain of the Inflation Reduction Act, of all of these big picture ideas we've talked about. How can investors approach potentially adding solar into their strategy?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRene Reyna\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I guess there's a lot of couple of ways, right? So hopefully you've heard over my comments. I talked about some of the value chain, if you will. So certainly there's ways to sort of handpick companies, if you're an integral stock buyer, to try and pick and choose those that you think could participate in this theme. I think there's some maybe more efficient ways. The ETF market allows you really to capture a theme. We here at Invesco actually have the industry's first and largest solar ETF. The ticker on that is $TAN. And really the approach of this fund, so it's a passive strategy, it's rules-based. We basically are tracking the max solar index. And what this index is comprised of is all the companies that sort of represent the solar value chain. And so what the methodology or the index does is it screens for companies that either will be considered a pure play, so two-thirds or more of their revenue is coming from the solar theme, and those would get sort of like a 1.0-factor weighting, if you will. And then companies that we consider medium plays. These are companies that have at least a third. And up to two-thirds of the revenue coming from the Solar theme. They'll get sort of a half of their weighting. And this then index sort of creates a list of companies. Currently, there are 44. It's a modified market cap. So it'll set limits on how much a company can represent in the portfolio. So the limit today is 10%. And then what happens is every quarter that those rules are reapplied and rebalanced on a quarterly basis. So you're ensuring you're maintaining ownership of these pure plays. I think an interesting thing as well as about this ETF, the solar landscape is global. So I mentioned China is a leader. We're seeing growth in Europe. And so you are going to have global representation in this US, which is important if you really want to capture the theme. So today, it's about 35% US exposure, 15% is coming from China, 12% is real. Then you have some smaller ones. You have some Germany holdings, Hong Kong. So it really gives you sort of that broad exposure to the theme. And it's just a convenient way in one ticker to get exposure. The fund is currently about two billion in size. So I mentioned it's one of the largest and it's got a cool ticker too, I mean, T-A-N, tan, easy to remember, think of the sun. And so it's been an easy way for investors to get pure-play exposure to this theme.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, certainly tan during the summertime. How could you forget it? So simple. All right, so Renee, this has been such a wonderful conversation. I really appreciate all of your incredible context and analysis, and insight. Feel like I've really learned a ton about this space right now. That has certainly gotten a lot of interest over the last several months and years. So thank you so much for coming on the public podcast and for sharing all of this with us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRene Reyna: \u003c/strong\u003eExactly. Absolutely great to be here, and again appreciate the opportunity to be on your podcast Kinsey.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003eThank you so much. And with that, I want to thank one more time our guest, Renee Reyna, head of thematic ETF product strategy at Invesco, for his time today.

I'm your host Kori Hale and of course, I'm always happy to be with you all, especially this afternoon. We're going to be breaking down what's going on in the regulatory environment as it relates to decentralized finance, better known as DeFi. We're going to be discussing crypto regulation, the recent actions taken by the US Treasury, along with the Securities Exchange Commission, and I am very thrilled to bring in our guest, Ari Redbord who is the Head of Legal and Government Affairs at TRM Labs to discuss crypto regulation. And of course, the road ahead in 2023. Ari, welcome to Public Live.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003eHey, Kori, thanks so much for having me and really excited to join Public Live today.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, we're happy to have you and to have this discussion. We have a lot of crypto enthusiasts within our community and I'd love to start out by talking specifically about the US Treasury Department. They recently initiated a risk assessment related to illicit financial activities within the sphere of this DeFi space, in your opinion, are what are the primary vulnerabilities exploited by illicit actors in the DeFi sector?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, no, it's a really important question. And to kind of set the conversation a little bit, this risk assessment was actually ordered by the White House framework on digital assets, which came out about a year ago. So while it sort of created somewhat of a regulatory framework, it definitely tasked a number of agencies and one of the tasks was for the US Treasury Department to do a risk assessment on D fi. And really, really important to note that this is just that it's a risk assessment with a focus on sort of what are the risks in the ecosystem/ It is not guidance, and it is certainly not regulation. And throughout the document, really Treasury talks about the need to engage with the private sector, with other agencies, and really have a conversation about ultimately, sort of what guidance or regulation should look like.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of that said, it focuses on the areas that you see also in this sort of centralized crypto space, whether it's ransomware. Hacks are a huge vulnerability for the DeFi ecosystem. In 2022, According to us at TRM, we saw about 3.7 billion in hacks, and about 80, or more percent of those hacks were against the DeFi ecosystem, bridges, protocols, Dex is and that's what it's a real concern. So there's a lot in this thing, but really, really important to understand, like, why does it talk about risk? Well, you know, that's exactly what it was intended to do is provide a risk assessment of the space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, a risk assessment, I think, many people would probably agree that's definitely needed, given the nature of DeFi. And especially what's happened in the past six to nine months in the broader crypto sector. But I'd love to dig into it a little bit more, because there are illicit actors, right? There are people that are, you know, in this space that are not necessarily trying to do good things. And that's what I'd love for you to explain to our audience. All right, how do these criminals actually use DeFi services? To do things like launder ill? ill gotten gains?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, no, it's really important. And whenever I talk about DeFi, I'm currently the vice chair of the CFTC Technology Advisory Committee as well. And as I said at our last meeting, look, if you're going to talk about DeFi regulation, you really have to start with the promise of this technology, right? This idea of sort of on-chain financial services, where we can have peer to peer transactions, you know, at the speed of the Internet. I think the technology is really, really extraordinary. But anytime you can move funds across border at the speed of the Internet, there are going to be vulnerabilities and illicit actors are going to try to take advantage of it and I think the challenge is for regulators, and Treasury really lays this out, is how do we sort of provide regulatory guardrails to make this ecosystem safe, but at the same time sort of not stifle innovation? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the really, really big takeaways, I mean, I think, for me, the most interesting of this risk assessment, is what it says is sort of about regulation. And again, you know, this is not guidance, this is not regulation, but Treasury says, look, if you are engaging in financial services, whatever your level of centralization is, right? DeFi, CiFi, or traditional finance, you have regulatory obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act, which is the US anti money laundering law. And I think that's probably going to be the most controversial piece of all of this, because there are a lot of sort of, you know, folks in the DeFi space who say, look, this is truly decentralized, disinter-mediated software that doesn't have teams of compliance professionals, it's sort of what we've seen in the traditional space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I think the regulatory piece is going to be a very big part of this. And to your question, I think what Treasury sees at least is, look, we have to ensure that there aren't gaps in regulation, and one of the gaps they see today is sort of non compliance in the DeFi space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eI mean, there definitely seems to be a lot of noncompliance. I want to pick up on something you said in terms of the Treasury, to look at how to not slow down innovation, but also, you know, providing, perhaps some type of risk parameters specifically, because we've seen this in other versions of tech, right, in different sectors where regulation has been at a much slower pace, right, than the actual technology and the innovation that's occurring. Is there something in what the Treasury is kind of proposing or what they're looking at that is specifically not going to slow down innovation? Are they always going to be two steps behind where DeFi is going? It?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri RedBord:\u003c/strong\u003eLook, I mean, government has always had this challenge. And I don't think we've ever seen anything move as fast in our lifetime, as we've seen the sort of crypto web three blockchain space. So it's always sort of this catch up game. Look, I think that you know, people are definitely appraising last week, the European Union, the European Parliament, passed Mica, the marketing crypto assets, legislation, really the first global sort of framework for digital assets, the sort of clear regulatory framework, and there's been a lot of praise around that. But when people sort of forget is that's about three years coming. That, you know, mica can't stem really from Facebook's sort of launch of the failed stable coin project Libra. So that's really three years ago, when European Parliament started thinking about Mica.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo the reality is that yes, you know, governments and regulators are always going to be sort of far behind the technology. But at the same time, I think what we're seeing in this risk assessment is an acknowledgement by Treasury and the US government that it's so important to bring the private sector into these conversations, because what we do well in the private sector is innovate. And so far, I think we've seen some of those conversations already take place, which I think is a really good sign. In other words, I don't know that we're going to see enforcement actions, I shouldn't say, I don't think we're going to see enforcement actions from Treasury, again, sort of DeFi for not having compliance controls in place over the next year. So I think what we're gonna see is conversation,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eif we start to see those conversations. are those conversations spearheaded by the DeFi, by industry, by that sector, right? So that, by the time, you know, the government, so to speak, decides to catch up and actually put some regulation in place. They're basically doing their own internal audits, as you mentioned, compliance sort of thing. And they're already kind of lining up the sector to say, hey, these are the standards and rules that we're setting across the board. You know, while the government back on Capitol Hill just tries to figure out what they think it is we should do?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003eYou know, it's an excellent question, this sort of self regulation question that permeates the space. And I think, look, if you think about the native qualities of public blockchains, right, they're transparent. They're immutable. So in other words, they allow for tracing and tracking the flow of funds in ways you really never could in traditional finance. And that also allows us in many respects, to kind of regulate ourselves right?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt TRM and a bunch of different industry players Circle and Binance and of others launched something called Chainabuse, which is essentially crowdsourcing, I think of it as the ways for crypto scams and frauds. It's a way this community can crowdsource to ensure that other people aren't taken by fraud and financial crime and you can report to law enforcement. So I say all of that to say like, I think that there are ways we can self-police the space in ways that were absolutely impossible in traditional finance, where we rely on intermediaries. So I think definitely, we are already seeing a world where not just DeFi but centralized exchanges are sort of coming together to sort of propose regulation and support regulation. But again, it's so important that this regulation doesn't go beyond what is intended to do and sort of stifle innovation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eWhen you talk about the companies and the things that people can do in this space, to perhaps self regulate, I guess it makes me think, Ari, what is what is after that, though, right? Because even if, regardless of if the government does it, or it's going to be self regulated, what happens to the illicit actors in the space? Are there sanctions? Are there obligations? If it's not going to be the government and it's going to be self regulated, who is the enforcer?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, no, it'll be the government, don't get me wrong, I think there's an aspect of self regulation that can actually absolutely occur, but I think it's gonna be a combination to be sure. And I will say this, look, you know, the nature of cryptocurrency, right? Cross border value transfer, this speed of the Internet is always going to be attractive to illicit actors. But when we see, you know, we see about the same amount of illicit activity in crypto as we do in the traditional financial system, which is a very, very small amount at the end of the day, almost infinitely small. So you're always going to have bad actors, right? If you don't have illicit actors in a financial system, it means the financial system is not robust, right? Bad guys are always going to want to engage, where sort of funds are flowing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of that said, sort of the nature of crypto and the ability for regulators to have a view of their regulated ecosystem, in real time for law enforcement to be able to track and trace the flow of funds on public blockchains. This all means that crypto could be a lot safer, ultimately, than Fiat, which relies on sort of, you know, siloed, intermediaries who report to the government suspicious activity reports and this sort of thing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I think the promise of the technology is, in part, the ability for regulators and law enforcement to use it and essentially, that's what we do at TRM. We provide software that enables that type of investigation and regulation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;I mean, that's good to know that your company is obviously out there already in the marketplace providing solutions to some of these issues. I'd love to shift our attention, though, for a second really quickly towards the SEC specifically, because they did send Coinbase a WELLS notice in regards to the firm listing unregistered securities on exchange, and some time, as we know has passed since Coinbase actually received the notice are what specific violations of security laws has the SEC accused Coinbase of? It kind of seems like they sent a letter and like not much has happened.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, no, look, there's this interesting..Certainly I'll first answer the question that is sort of, you know, the SEC is essentially saying look, Coinbase is listing unregistered securities, because certain cryptocurrencies are in SEC’s view, sort of most cryptocurrencies today are securities. And that's essentially the genesis of this letter. But that said, this is the issue that is permeating the entire space in the United States today. And it's really a definitional question, you know, are certain cryptocurrency securities? Are their commodities? Or are they something else? And every issue, whether it's sort of the CFTC, recent action involving finance, you know, talks about Ethereum as a commodity, but the SEC has talked about Ethereum as a security, or sees the asset rather as a security, and we see this letter to Coinbase. You know, there are cases involving, you know, sports celebrities and endorsers of FTX where one of the arguments in the case is that they were promoting unregistered securities. So ultimately, that question will be answered in that case, maybe from state to state courts.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I say all of this to say that the biggest issue today in our space is, you know, are things commodities? Are things securities? And ultimately, you know, we're going to continue to see see enforcement actions and regulatory action, until Congress ultimately provides legal clarity and actually says, hey, look, Bitcoin is a commodity, and these other assets are you know, securities, or maybe even something else. And I think my view is that, look, you know, this technology is so new and so extraordinary, that maybe this can be something else. But I think the real issue is we need that type of legal clarity and probably needed from Congress. And until we get that, we're going to continue to see sort of disagreement amongst regulators and continued sort of enforcement actions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, it definitely seems like the story continues to unfold in this space, because Coinbase as many of us know, here, they did take legal action against the SEC. And to be honest, that's not something you typically see companies do is take action against one of these government institutions, but this just happened on Monday related to the lack of clarity on securities regulations presented to the firm. Can you just explain for us? I'd love for you to break this down? What is Coinbase asking the court to do in its latest action against the SEC? And also did Coinbase do this, decide to take legal action against the SEC and for lack of a better term retaliation?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, look, I think, you know, you know, obviously, this latest action by Coinbase is, you know, is sort of the latest example, but really what we've been seeing for the last, you know, several months or even more, really a year, are businesses looking for clarity from somebody, whether it's the courts, whether it's guidance from regulators, which is really in this case, sort of what Coinbase is asking the court to\u0026nbsp;make sure to get the regulator to provide, but it's like, look, you know, there's enforcement actions, you know, against us for listing unregulated securities in the words of Coinbase. But, you know, no one's ever told us, you know, what’s a security and what's a commodity here, they've only sort of proposed that, you know, we have obligations under a, you know, 60, or 70 year old Supreme Court case called US versus Howey where there's a conversation of whether or not orange groves and enterprise around orange groves are securities, are investment contracts. So I think what it is, is Coinbase and really, it's not just Coinbase it’s across the entire industry, is looking for clarity, you know, before you bring an enforcement actions, says Coinbase, or other entities, you know, we need an explanation, we need guidance from you as to what is a security and what is not a security?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and whether or not they get that guidance before all of this back and forth, you know, legal dispute that's now, you know, taking plays really comes to a head, I guess, only time will tell because, as you mentioned earlier, things are happening so quickly in this space quicker than we've seen, and other tech enabled spaces and there, there's a lot of moving parts right, Ari to work out here? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003eThere are so many and at this point, you know, we have the executive branch I mentioned, you know, our conversation today started with Treasury, right, and you have the SEC, and you have the CFTC. And you have the Fed, all involved in this. We have the legislative branch, we had a hearing last week on stable coins. And there's a proposed stable coin bill out there, which we're told is not going to necessarily, you know, move without some revisions. We have a number of other bills that have been proposed in Congress, but really no activity there. We have. And then we have the courts to your sort of last point, right.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo we have all these different branches of government, you know, trying to sort of parse out a lot of these questions. But ultimately, it will come down to Congress to provide that sort of legislative clarity. And I'm not I'm not entirely sure that will be anytime soon. So we're likely to continue to see some of this sort of regulatory action from these agencies.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, I'm sure that your company will, of course, be keeping a close eye on all the movements in this space, and we at Public will be definitely updating our community as things progress. Alright, I just want to thank you so much for joining Public live this afternoon, everyone. Once again, this is Ari Redbord - he's the head of legal and Government Affairs at TRM Labs. Thank you so much, Ari.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAri Redbord: \u003c/strong\u003eHey, thanks so much for having me and looking forward to coming back soon.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eAll right, perfect.

I'm Kinsey Grant, your host today and I am so excited to welcome on our fantastic guest. With us now is Michael Pachter, a research analyst at Wedbush Securities.\u0026nbsp; Michael, how are you today?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Pachter:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e I'm good. Thank you, Kinsey. Thanks for having me.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOf course super excited to have this conversation. Today we are going to be talking about Nintendo, more specifically the outlook for Nintendo as we move ahead into the rest of the year into some big launches for the company. We're going to get your perspective on what comes next for Nintendo. So if you're ready, we can kick right off.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Pachter:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e I'm ready.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAlright, sounds great. So Michael, can you give us a quick overview into Nintendo's business strategy, where it generates revenue, how it operates as a business. Tell me a little bit more about that 30,000 foot view. What is he big picture for Nintendo's business?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Pachter: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSure. They were founded in 1865, I think 1865 or 1869, I always get the year mixed up. And they were like a trading card company. And they kind of invented that in Japan, and you know, muddle along, made money and discovered video games in the 70s with arcade style games. So many people, I'm not sure very many of your viewers have actually ever played an arcade game in an arcade, but Donkey Kong was their first giant hit. And it was Mario running up a ramp and avoiding barrels being thrown by the gorilla who is Kong. So Donkey Kong was Mario trying to get past Kong, and get through all the levels and ultimately, free Princess Peach from being kidnapped.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThat allowed them to generate a lot of wealth, and they decided that they were going to bring the arcade experience to the home. So they're one of the early home console makers, Atari actually might have beat them to it. There's another company Colico, another company in television, all of them watch consoles around the same time in the 80s. And Nintendo’s was the most popular of the many consoles launched - the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985. And I think that the reason that their console worked and the other guys didn't, is that Nintendo had content, that is, Mario to start. They kept expanding their content library, and they've launched consoles since 1990. The Super NES 1997 in ‘64. In 2001, the GameCube. In 2006 The Wii, which was enormously popular. Then they did the Wii U in 2013, which was terrible. And then the Switch in 2017, which has been very good. They've had a ton of handhelds. The Gameboy was the original, Gameboy Color, Gameboy Advance, Gameboy Advance SP, the DSX you know, and then the 3DS before the switch. If any of your viewers have watched the new Apple TV plus movie, Tetris, that's actually the story of how the Tetris Company was formed, and the key was getting on the Gameboy. So the Nintendo platform was so popular that these guys were minting money. But at the same time, they've developed about 30 different big brands on the Nintendo platform that they own. So among them Zelda and Kirby, and the Smash Brothers Mario Kart, and so Mario is the biggest one.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTheir strategy has really not changed much in the last 40 years. They've been focused on the console and their strategy is to create proprietary software meaning software they own for their proprietary console, so the only way you can play their game is to buy their console. And the other guys aren't that way, Sony and Microsoft have consoles, their total sales of first party, their own IP are under 10% of their total revenue. So, you know, Nintendo is more like north of 50 - it has been as high as 80%. So Nintendo has a different strategy than the other guys. And the departure recently from that strategy, which is not meaningful, but it's interesting is that they really started to focus on licensing their IP, and getting opportunities elsewhere. So you start to see them on mobile a bit. They're not really good at it yet. But again, they only own 31% of Pokemon Company, Pokemon Go, it's been a giant mobile title. But the big, big change lately is this Mario Brothers movie.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo the Super Mario movie is really driving a lot of awareness of the brand. And if you roll back, again, you're probably about 1. But back in 2000, there were surveys of the most recognizable brands of the 20th century. And you can look this up to this, this is findable on Google, the number one brand ahead of Coca Cola, you know ahead of anything else was Nintendo. So they are the most recognized brand on the planet. And yet, you know, their cumulative console sales, maybe have hit 250 million households, I don't think that could possibly be even close to a billion households. Yet, there are 3or 4 billion people on the planet who know what Nintendo is.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo the recent strategy shift has been to license the content to other media, like movies, to get even more awareness of the brand. I think you're going to start seeing, you know, Nintendo lunch pails, lunch boxes for the kids, Nintendo pajamas, you know, Nintendo plush toys. And I think that'll work. And ultimately, what that does is drive greater awareness and more interest in the brand, which will help them sell software and hardware. So they do great. They're making tons of money, the hardware sales spiked during COVID. And they've kind of pulled back lately, but we're talking about the difference between, you know, 21-22 million hardware units down to maybe 19, or 20. So it's not like they got cut in half - they just peaked. And now they've plateaued. I don't see a lead up anytime soon. They're due for product refresh. They haven't launched a new console in a while. So probably next year, there should be a Switch 2 or something, some upgraded Switch. And Nintendo has been pretty smart on the hardware side. They try to build their hardware and sell it at a profit so they tend to use commodity components rather than cutting edge technology. If you look at Sony and Microsoft, they both lose money on every console, Nintendo makes money on every console. So as a consequence, their consoles are less powerful than the other two. But their content is great so it doesn’t seem to matter to their fans.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah. And I think you bring up a really important point here, which is this idea that, you know, licensing IP, I think, for most of these companies that we're talking about, but not Nintendo specifically, I imagine the margins can be much higher on licensing IP than they can be on creating technology, creating software and hardware that require a lot of inputs that require a lot of very brilliant minds. And also a lot of parts to be made. You know that that is something that I don't want to discount here.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut getting a little bit more into this idea of how important IP is for Nintendo as a company. Talk to me a little bit more about this. The Super Mario Brothers movie released in North America in early April pulled in around $380 million in its opening weekend, which is way I think out of you know, outperformed a lot of the expectations that were placed out there for this film. It was co-financed by Nintendo and Universal Pictures, how many more big, you know, major scaled projects like that, like a Super Mario Brothers movie do you see coming for Nintendo? You know, is this setting a new precedent for the company in terms of licensing IP or the project is going to be as big as you know, a major film release that blew expectations out of the water? Do you expect more of that?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Pachter: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe economics aren't clear, and I know that the companies announced that the film was co-financed, but my understanding is that Nintendo didn't put any money in. Instead, they contributed the intellectual property obviously, and they lent technical talent so they let their creative developers Miyamoto, who is the head of their studios, to the project to ensure that the characters had brand integrity that they did.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIf you have Mario with five arms or or 10 fingers on each hand, and I think that it's likely that their net net profit on this will be something around, you know, 10% of the total film gross, which is still a big number, this film is going to do $2 billion, when they're all done, I mean, between box office and, and all the different DVD sales and pay per view and streaming service fees and licensing to broadcast TV. So they'll make a couple 100 million dollars, that's enough to get them interested in doing it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAgain, this is one of the bigger projects for Universal. And this is the biggest animated film opening I think of all time. So Universal certainly is going to be interested in doing more and more of this. And for Universal, they make even more money, obviously, because they own the animation studio. So they're going to want to do more and more and more. And there'll be a balance, I think that Nintendo doesn't want to over saturate the market. And they certainly don't want to have any brand failures. But I would expect that you'll see another film within three years. I don't think it's going to be annual for a while.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIt takes a lot to be like Disney and put out, you know, a Marvel film every three months, which they do. I don't think Nintendo is there yet. Could they get to one a year in the next 10 years? Sure. So it's a nice profit contributor, but the bigger impact of the film is just brand awareness that, you know, they end up having, say 500 million people see the film, you know, at most half of those people are Nintendo current customers and the other half are not. And ultimately they're going to win over a whole generation of people who are going to be interested. And it also opens up the opportunity for them to sell, you know, figurines.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAs an example, when the Mandalorian came out, I bought my wife a couple of Growgu characters, and we hadn't seen the show yet. She's like, Why do I want these? And now she thinks they're super cute.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo if Disney's brilliant at Merchandising, and Nintendo has not been. And I expect that Nintendo will get brilliant at merchandising, I think that could open up another couple of 100 million a year of profit. So I can see this company really building on the success of the Super Mario movie, but I can't tell you that they'll do anything for the next two or three years.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Totally, totally. And to your point, you know, the pace with which a company like Disney can put out movies in a franchise like Marvel is astounding. And you know, every single actor in Hollywood these days is somehow tied to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which is wild. But with that in mind, it brings to I think, this conversation the the concept of going back to things that work versus creating a new idea or following some sort of new potential concept idea, or content idea or content concept, you know, when we think about Super Mario Brothers has been around to your point where it's being introduced to a new generation, but it was around for my generation, for the younger people in the generation ahead of me, you know that this not really a new franchise.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd the same goes with Zelda. I know that there's a big release in the Zelda franchise happening next month that a lot of gaming creators are really excited for. But how important is it for Nintendo to come up with the next Mario or the next Zelda? Is that something that you think companies like Nintendo or even Nintendo itself are considering? Or are they really doubling down on returning to what they know works and adding new elements to those franchises that do work versus trying to come up with, you know, totally brand new ideas - blank white sheet of paper trying to figure out what's next?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Pachter: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou know, it's a great question. I don't see Nintendo innovating on their existing brands, you will see them create new brands like Animal Crossing, but new that probably is 10 years old. So it's not like that. That's something they did this past year, in the last 20 years. I doubt that they've done more than two big new brands. They have, I counted not for this interview I counted for another reason, there are 30 brands at Nintendo that have sold multiple millions of units of games. So they have 30 established franchises. I promise you Marvel doesn't have 30. I mean, we think that they have 4000 characters, but they don't have 30 brands. And, you know, Disney's managed to do something with that. DC doesn't have 30. You know, but the difficulty in exploiting those brands is, you know, that you have to create a fun, compelling story around them. And I think with 30 brands, Nintendo's got plenty to continue to pump out, you know, three or four big games a year, movies.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIt's interesting because some brands are really great movies like Guardians of the Galaxy, where the brand itself as a comic book wasn't that big a deal. I mean, it was popular but I don't think anybody in this room, I'd say fewer than 10% of the people who are aware of the Guardians of the Galaxy brand will ever have seen the comic book. They learned about the brand from the movie. And that's the right way to build brands, you know that you don't have to build the brand on the comic book.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo an Animal Crossing movie might be good, or a Yoshi Island movie might be good. But we'll definitely get another Animal Crossing game. And we'll definitely get another Yoshi’s Island game. And as I said, there's so many of them that, you know, I don't think Nintendo has to worry about new IP anytime soon.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTotally - and Animal Crossing. I can't help but ask your perspective on the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on Nintendo as a business and how Animal Crossing became enormous. People were stuck at home, everybody wanted a Nintendo Switch, they were actually incredibly difficult to get for a time.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI'm curious about how the you know, coming out of the the thick of the COVID 19 pandemic might impact how Nintendo moves forward knowing that they did have this this significant moment in the sun, I would say especially with the switch, which I believe is in its seventh fiscal year next, year heading into its seventh fiscal year next year. So it's not a brand new product, you mentioned that you're expecting some sort of a refurbish or a refresh.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHow do you think Nintendo is going to rise to the occasion to make sure that you know now that everybody is kind of going back to their regular lives, not really at home quite as much, what is Nintendo going to do to make sure that those people want to buy the next generation of a switch?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Patcher\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e: Yeah, I mean, one of the things Nintendo has pioneered and yet failed to exploit adequately is the concept of user generated content. So they've created these Super Mario Maker software packages that allow you to create your own characters and do your own thing. Animal Crossing, let you do that, you can customize your character. And so when I say they pioneered it and failed to exploit, there were brands that were building things inside Animal Crossing. So you could literally wear Burberry, Burberry sweater, or carry a Louis Vuitton bag. And yet, Nintendo failed to exploit that.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo they didn't create a storefront and let you know, only allow the brand to create the Burberry sweater and then let the brand sell you the sweater. And can you imagine if you could buy a Burberry sweater in the game for $1? You know, Burberry would have made 20 million bucks. And why not? Like how does that hurt them? You know, it has 20 million people, you know, wearing their sweater, it helps us. So I think Nintendo is smart. I think their management team is smart. I like the current CEO a lot.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHe'll get that right in the next iteration. So that'll be fun. I think that again, who knows what they're going to do with that next generation switch. But if they allow more creator tools, and they allow you more interoperability, so maybe create something and broadcast that TikTok video or Twitch video through your console, which Sony allows you to do now, I think you get a lot more creative talents. And if you open up the opportunity to create to everybody, you end up enriching the world because you end up with something like America's Got Talent or American Idol, where you get these amateurs who are really talented, and they turn into superstars, you know, so Carrie Underwood, came out came off of a farm in Oklahoma and is a star. And it's hard to know that she would have been discovered but for the opportunity for amateurs to compete, you know, in public.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI think Nintendo exploits that type of concept, and let's amateurs create within the switch to universe. I think they'll come up with really great content, and I think there's an opportunity to make money.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, incredibly interesting. Who's the Carrie Underwood for Nintendo is a fun question to ponder here.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo Michael, I want to talk for a second here about risks and sort of the future, we’ll future cast just a little bit here. You have an outperform rating for Nintendo shares said in a recent report that the stock presents a favorable risk reward profile. I would love to hear you explain that just a little bit and talk to me a little about the risks that might materialize for Nintendo in the medium and long term.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Patcher: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThey're a pretty dependable company. So they're pretty easy to forecast. Their hardware sales, as I said, don't vary by more than 10% either way. So the odds of them forecasting 20 million switch sales coming in at 10, that's pretty close to zero. They forecast 20 that comes in at 18, they're not going to be thrown from profit to loss, they're going to make a little less money. And it's just as likely that it goes from 20 million to 22. They still have the tool in their pocket of price cuts, and they haven't cut the price much if at all. They've introduced three now three models of the switch, they have the switch light, the regular switch, and the switch OLED.\u0026nbsp; I could see them cutting the price of each of those by 50 bucks, and suddenly you would see sales go up. And they'll still make money because the cost of manufacture and shipping has gone way down as the supply chain has gotten more normal.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo I really say low, low low risk on hardware. Software is more a function of release schedule. So you know, if they release a new game, every three months, they're fine. If they miss one, and it takes six months, they might not make as much profit as we forecast. And if they missed two or three, and we go a year or two without, without a new software title, that's a problem. But they've been pretty dependable since the Switch launch that I've seen them really miss anything. You know, delaying Zelda, a few months doesn't matter. That's time value of three months of cash, it's not that big a deal.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo I'd say risks are very, very low. The reward opportunity, you know, the upside is that when they cut price, they surprise us with a better lineup. And we get more software sales. You know, Zelda is not the best selling game of all time, you know, Mario Kart is, the big surprise for upside would be that there's a Mario Kart 9. You know, which the last Mario Kart I think came out in 2014. It's been a long, long time. So they're really due for something like that. That could be huge. And I would guess that that's their next movie. And so I would guess that you're going get Mario Kart game and Mario Kart movie kind of at the same time. And, and that's where I think they surprise the upside. So I, there's more opportunity for them to beat than there is for them to miss.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight. All right. So Michael, this has been wonderful. I have one last question for you for the road. Before we wrap things up here. Just while I have you, Roblox. I would love to get your perspective. Your take on Roblox recently reported monthly key metrics for March that perhaps fell a bit short of expectations. I know you have a neutral rating and a $37 price target for that stock. What are your general thoughts just quickly on Roblox as a company right now,\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Patcher: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThey, you know, they don't disclose their monthly active users, but the number is around 300 million. And that's not even close to saturation. I mean, they could get to a billion users. But the way to do that is to expand the product offering to appeal to people older than 20. And I don't mean to suggest that their content isn’t good, it is. It's just that as you age, you're much more interested in shooter games like Call of Duty, or, you know, role playing games like World of Warcraft.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd so the way to get that type of content is to expand the platform. And the way to expand the platform is to rev share at a higher rate for recognizable content. I think they can. And I actually like their management. And I think that they know that they need to do this, but they haven't done it yet. So I don't see this company getting to the growth implied by its share price until they shift the business model, share more of the revenue with developers and attract games that appeal to older people. And you know, they have a couple of quarters of stagnant growth. That's really what's going on there. The growth is okay, but not as good as people expected. If they have a couple of quarters, stagnant growth, I expect that they'll make a shift. So I'm waiting until it happens. I guess I could forecast the exact date it will happen, but I don't know. If we see an indication that they're going to change them, then we obviously will look at them more favorably, but I haven't seen that yet.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight. All right. Well, we'll just have to check back in at a later date. Michael, this has been so wonderful. Thank you so much for your time and all of your incredible insights. I've really enjoyed this conversation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Patcher: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThank you, Kinsey.

All right, folks. Let's do it. A very cool topic on a very timely day for it and well, we're joined by Mark Mahaney, Senior Managing Director at Evercore ISI, the research division to talk all things Amazon and like I said, what a day for it. Amazon entering the generative AI race through AWS with the introduction of bedrock you may have seen in the headlines the last few hours. It's set to allow clients to leverage and customize AI tools to generate text similar to the way the Chat GPT does. And Mark Mahaney is here who else better to talk about it. We'll also talk a little bit of tech preview as well ahead of earnings season. Mark, thanks for being here. Nice to have you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eGood to be here. Thanks for including me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eAbsolutely. I do need to embarrass you just a bit with a plug. For people who don't know, Mark is also the author of a new book – it’s called “Nothing But Net: 10 Timeless Stock-Picking Lessons from One of Wall Street’s Top Tech Analysts,” and we are doing book giveaways here at Public. So, if you want to get your hands on a copy, just send a DM to the Public live handle. Okay, Mark, thank you for being here. First, congrats on the book, I first want to just get your takeaway for the shareholder letter. It's always nice to hear from Andy Jassy. What most stood out to you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eWhat most stood out is that, like every year, this is kind of a thoughtful review of what's happened to the company over the last year and what their current priorities are for the next year – I know that sounds really basic. I think all CEOs should write shareholders like this. In the book I went through the first 25 first years of the Bezos shareholder letters, and I pulled out key themes from each year. There was a dramatic focus on customer satisfaction and a dramatic focus on innovation – and you kind of still see that here today. But, if there were a couple of new themes that really stuck out, cost – focused on cost efficiencies, and there's a series of items in this letter about how they looked at all of their businesses, whether it was AWS, retail, both international and in the US, their advertising business, the layoffs and just kind of a recognition that demand trends have softened, and they needed to tighten their belts. And so that was one – that was new. I mean, I think you would have seen this in 08-09, you know, back during the great financial crisis, but we haven't had a shareholder letter focus on cost reductions and cost efficiency, so it's a sign of the times.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then I think the second area had to do with innovations in each of the segments. So, in retail, they have sped up deliveries and they talked about Prime deliveries should be at their fastest pace this year like if you're ordering Amazon retail products via Prime, you should get the product faster this year to your home, to your apartment, wherever than you did in the past, that's a good investment. They also tease some of these improvements that you also teased on the AWS side.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then the third point is just a reminder that Amazon's actually been aggressively investing in machine learning and artificial intelligence, you know, for the better part of a decade, and it's in there in terms of the product announcements, the the product feed, or the recommendations that they've given, and it's been in there in terms of the AWS products, the bedrock announcement is a little different. But you know, it's a different level, it’s different scale, but the investments have been there – and so I think they kind of also wanted to use a shareholder letter, Andy did, just to kind of raise his hand and say, “Hey, I know we didn't talk about the last earnings call, but we actually are a machine learning and AI company and by the way, we have been for a decade.” So I thought those were the three most interesting things in the shareholder letter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, we also heard him on that last earnings call as well, which I think all of us that listen in on those sorts of things, we want to hear from someone in that position. We haven't historically, and we don't always from big companies. So that's worth noting as well. I wonder, before we move on, was there anything with regards to macro concerns to how the company is positioned for high interest rates? I don't know that we would hear much directly with concerns over tightening credit or potential credit crunch like we do a lot of other companies, but anything you think, for people to know, in terms of potential way, big picture headwinds for the company?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eI don't think so. The line in here that I'm staring at now is, “While the short term headwinds soften our growth rate, we'd like a lot of funnels now fundamentals that we're seeing at AWS.” So they're acknowledging the short term headwinds, right up front, and they should, because you know, if you step back on AWS, this was a 30% year-over-year revenue grower up until the middle of last year, and now in this March quarter that they're going to print in two to three weeks, the dates not set yet, they're going to print something like 12 13%, like the growth rates have been cut in half in in a year's time, that's always something that's a little bit alarming, and for any company, but I think it's very much a reflection of softening macro environment. And then what Amazon is doing, or AWS is doing to respond to that, which is they're aggressively going after and bringing down pricing in order to help their customers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eSo you mentioned, it seems as if the company was pretty eager to remind people to say, hey, we're still here in the AI conversation, folks who really haven't gotten anywhere, obviously, much of the chatter may sort of be dominated by other names in the space. But talk to me more about what we learned about bedrock specifically, and any other thoughts, Mark that you have, as they look to integrate it into its cloud offering, certainly a big priority for the company at a really important time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, unlike Microsoft, and Google, Amazon's not going to have a generative AI LLM – “Large Language Model” out there. But what they are doing is AWS’ bread and butter has always been selling to devs. What I mean by that is developers, the people who create the large language models, and so they're just that that's kind of what they're doing with bedrock, which is saying that they're rolling out more tools to help LLM developers GAI, that's Generative AI developers, build their models build their tools, that just reminding people that, you know, they, there are tools provider, that's where they're playing in this, this AI race, in addition to doing normal things like storage and compute for their customers.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I don't know if that's helpful or not, you're going to see them kind of in the weeds on generative AI and in the weeds on LLMS,\u0026nbsp;allowing developers, creators to create and develop those models, rather than, you know, running the flashy front-end consumer service. So that's also why they'll probably be somewhat under-appreciated in terms of their AI competencies. I just think the broad point is, Amazon's fully involved in AI. They've been using it to improve their processes, they've been using artificial intelligence for everything from book selections to you to where in a warehouse where they actually put products so that they can most quickly have people or robots pick up those products and put them in packages and ship them off to you. And then they use it for advertising and they use that in AWS. So that's just a reminder, because I think maybe the market needed one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, well, to that point, do you think the company almost deserves more credit or deserves to be more a part of the active chat GPT AI adjacent conversation?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eYes, they do. But you need to think about them as a company that’s already been investing in machine learning and AI for their core operations. And then when it comes to large language models, which is what Chat GPT is, they're the company – that’s who open AI will use. Actually, I don't know if they use AWS, but the other open AIs because there's a lot of other large language models and applications being built, they'll be built or a substantial percentage of them will be built on AWS. So AWS is kind of the tools vendor, the picks and shovels vendor, to the AI community, to the generative AI community. That's something that I think the market had kind of forgotten.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eSure. Andy Jassy said this morning on Squawk he doesn't focus too closely on the company's stock price. What did data say – it's currently up 4.4%, with under two hours left in training here, you have an outperform rating, if I'm not mistaken, you recently lowered your own price target to 155 from 160. Again, with a bump today, it's trading right around 102. Talk to me about your decision to bid more, Mark, to drop that target and are you still finding yourself being positive for a long term case?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, I can be near term cautious. I do think what he's saying in the shareholder letter, and he's warning people, is that trends are softening\u0026nbsp;even at AWS. And, you know, the facts of the facts, we've had a dramatic deceleration and growth rate, you know, you go from 30% to 10% revenue growth in a year, year and a half. That's not healthy, that's not bullish. And I think that things are likely to get worse at AWS before they get better, but they will get better. And, and for long term investors, which is what I really pitch people to be on Amazon, I pitched that you'd think about Amazon in 2023, is what I would call a DHQ stock, that's the concept that's in my book a “Dislocated High Quality” stock. Another way to think about it is it's a trough multiple stock on trough earnings. And you know, it's cyclical. And as these companies get bigger and bigger, of course, they're more cyclical, you can't escape the economy if you become a bigger, bigger contributor to it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo what I think is so interesting about the setup on Amazon is, there may be a little disappointment about AWS results in the March quarter, or the June quarter guide, but we're going to get revenue growth acceleration as we go into ‘24, for their advertising, business, retail business, and for AWS, and you're going to get margin expansion and improvement and free cash flow. And I'm telling you all that when the stock is sitting here at a multi-year, multiple or trough multiple, a low multiple, and so that's, you know, that's the time when you step in, and you can make money, you may even be dealing with volatility over the next quarter. I don't know that there's a ton of downside volatility, but there'll be some. And I think if you're willing to look out a year, I think this is a great time to buy Amazon shares.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eI don't want to pull the conversation away from Amazon, but I'm hoping quickly, can you talk to us more about DHQs and any other household names people may be familiar with and why they fit that mold?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eGoogle is another one I think that fits that DHQ category. The old saying in the market says buy low, sell high, and I'm kind of saying buy high low. So you know, find a high quality company measured, you know, the book goes through it, but measured on the how good the management team is, how good the level of product innovation is at the company, how large the market opportunities, find those high quality companies and just wait for them to get dislocated, because they all get dislocated because there are market rollovers. That's obviously what we faced in Texas last year. There are mis-executions, because no company is perfect and they’ll make mis-executions. And then when you get those pull backs in the stock, that's when you step in, but first find a high quality company and I'll just take my reputation as I have historically that Amazon is one of those I think Google is to and it seems to me like the fears, you know, the near term and long term fears are well overstated on both of these names. I think they're both very good franchises so those would be two. You know, you can buy at a multiple, you can buy Google and Amazon at about the cheapest multiples you've had a chance to buy at in the last five years. I don't think you're going to regret buying both of those stocks here as DHQ opportunities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eI have all potential opportunities for Amazon, whether it's logistics, groceries, health care, talk to me about what you personally are most excited about. What do you think makes the most impact? Or is it something that maybe we haven't even yet discussed, Mark?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, let me check off some items or count them out. People talking about what Amazon is doing in healthcare - that's always been a head scratcher for me.\u0026nbsp;I'm just not convinced that – I think that's a huge market, but doesn't mean that Amazon should be going into it, so I'm skeptical about that. So I just want to start off with what I'm skeptical about.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat I'm positive about is I think they can be a lot bigger and advertising now that they've just got a lot more content. All of their advertising, most of their advertising revenue so far has come from sponsored ads within their shopping results. But if they start putting advertisements against all of that premium content, video content that they have, I think that's a segment of the business that can double in the next five years, their advertising business. And then I want to get a little bit more blue sky, I talked about this, that logistics business, that buy with Prime. I mean, that's the FedEx competitor, that's the UPS competitor, and I'm pretty damn sure that Amazon's going after that, and it's tiny, tiny, tiny for them now, but I think that its low margin business, but Amazon knows how to handle its low margin businesses, I think that's going to be one.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then the last one I'd point to is business and industrial supplies. And I think what Amazon's vision here is to, is to connect the world's factories with the world's consumers, and, the world's factories with the world's businesses and people under-appreciate that latter one. And so it's industrial supplies, business supplies, look, Amazon's got the fulfillment network out there. They've got vans and people who deliver products to consumers, it's just a different stop. Now, there's a lot of other things that go into getting into procurement cycles for businesses. But I think that that's a big opportunity. I'm actually surprised they're not figuring that now. So that to me, is kind of one of the sleepers. So, the big sleepers for me are that, advertising and then that logistics business.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eReal quick, not the most important question I'm going to ask you, but what's your favorite show on Amazon Prime since you mentioned content? I ask the important stuff, Mark. I'm a very serious journalist, you know me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eI think you've got me. I can tell you what my favorite books that I've been reading on Amazon Kindle. I'm not much of a movie person. You asked the wrong guy. I apologize.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, no –\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003efair enough. I didn't mean to put you on the spot. Lots of good book options as well. Let me ask you about earnings season, of course, right around the corner. In your last note or a recent note, rather, you say you are tactically constructive. Talk to us more about that line of thinking, what you would want people to know, and some of the key factors that are driving that particularly out there?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so we're making four points. One is that multiples have been de-risked. estimates have been de-risked. What we've had are all these job cuts, you know, cost actions, as painful as they are, over the last year, over the last six months really, these intense rounds of layoffs and, and cuts that's created what I call these EPS slingshot opportunities. This is the third reason why we're more tactically constructive – because when eventually revenue growth really accelerates it is going to do it on a lower cost base. So that means you're going to get a real launch, or slingshot when it comes to earnings. And then the fourth reason why we're tactically constructive, or really constructive is AI. I think there's a lot of opportunities for digitally savvy companies and I think there's a fair number of them in the internet space, to take advantage of AI models and really create something interesting. So I think there are these reasons and so then I'll just end up with what stocks do we like? Well, our number one pick here is meta. Number two pick is Uber. And number three pick is Netflix. Those are 2023 stock picks. If I'm willing to look longer than that, I'm definitely throwing Amazon and Google into the mix.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eNice.

I'm your host Ann Berry and in this session, we are getting the lowdown or the down low on the high end luxury retail market and diving into the businesses of Hermes and LVMH. With us now is Marie Driscoll, Senior Analyst at Coresight Research to unpack their business models a little further. Marie, thank you so much for joining today.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThank you for having me. It's an honor and a privilege.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMarie, can you just talk about - super high level just to paint the picture for us - the current state of the luxury retail market and how it has been impacted by inflation and a slowing growth outlook?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSure. So this is 2023. New Year, new time. The last few years, you know just to recap, luxury really skyrocketed during COVID luxury products are the most experiential of all products. And while people were locked in, unable to travel, unable to eat out their lives somewhat constrained, they sought luxury products and a lot of people had additional income because you weren't spending on experiences. So luxury became the new experience. And in fact, the luxury market captured a lot of new consumers. As we ended 2022, there's still you know, in America, there's a lot of pent up demand for travel. We were traveling last year to Europe where you saw lots of luxury purchases transpire in Europe, where in 2021, many of them, and in 2020, they occurred in the US market. The U.S. market took over as the number one market in the last few years where it had been like China are the number one consumers it moved to America. We've seen a lot of shifting happen in the last few years. So as we enter this year, you have a shift back to experiences which consumers want to have, they want to travel and travel has inflationary prices of 25 to 50%. Consumers want to eat out, there's inflation across the board, and the economy is somewhat weakening. So that's one backdrop that's happening.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAt the same time, though, you have the China market opening up. We saw that happen in February. China was really under a lockdown last year so luxury really suffered. So as the Chinese began to travel domestically, and then as this year and next year progressed internationally, they will resume their – we assume they'll resume their love affair with all things luxury. So the big things as we head into this year are the pace of the reopening of China post the pandemic and what was a dampened demand for China for luxury by the Chinese is that resume. And then what's happening in the U.S. economy, there's mounting job losses with the Vigilant fed fighting inflation. The stock market is volatile, and these are factors that impact consumer sentiment and their willingness to spend on discretionary purchases.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut as I said, during COVID, we got a lot of new luxury shoppers. It's projected that by 2030, about 75% or more of all luxury purchases will be made by millennials and younger. You have a lot of people that discovered luxury and luxury is sticky. Luxury is better quality. It romances people. It impacts the way people think about themselves. And we believe that they'll be trading down in some more commodity type products, like in the brown beans that you buy, maybe in the jeans that you buy.\u0026nbsp; In apparel, we see a trade down, but luxury we think has stickiness. That said, you know, if you lose your job, you're not going to be buying luxury products.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Let's talk about stickiness, mobile, let's also talk about it in the context of pricing. I feel as though there are constantly these articles being published about how Rolex watches Hermes bags, have seen prices skyrocket under the guise of inflation in part but also because demand seems to have gone up from these new demographics. Can you talk about how price sensitive or not luxury is? Not all luxury is created equal if you break it down by category for us?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e No, no. So not all luxury is created equal and I mean, the real trick of luxury and really any product category is to best match supply and demand. With luxury you want to have demand outpacing supply. And that's what happened during COVID. More people wanted an Hermes handbag or wanted an Hermes bracelet. Then Hermes was able to meet that demand. Some of it was supply chain constraints, and some of that there were more people entering the market that wanted these things.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou also see that in resale if you're a student of the markets, you see that resale has provided pricing transparency into your first purchase. So you could buy a Hermes handbag newer or\u0026nbsp; Louis Vuitton handbag new and see that in the aftermarket, you can get 80 to 150% of what you paid for. So it's brought a new kind of shopper into the market. Also, if you buy in consignment it is where you can often meet that need for a luxury product today. You don't have to wait six months for it. It's In the aftermarket.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNot all products are equal. Certainly Hermes is, you know, unique in its ability to keep consumers panting for demand of you know their Birkin bag or their Kelly bag. But, and you've seen while Gucci was really driving incredible demand through COVID. By the end of COVID. Really, it became.. it was time to move on to another product. So partly as luxury becomes entwined with high priced designer brands, designer design and fashion are different than true luxury.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd let's talk a little bit about where Hermes and LVMH specifically fall on the luxury pricing spectrum. Marie, do you expect the higher end brands like there to be more recession proof than mid tier luxury brands? I mean, as you look at overall demand as distinct printers, price sensitivity, where do you see those learned?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThere are two different companies. Hermes has this one brand with sub-brands. Birkin is a brand, but it's really one brand, Louis Vuitton is a company that consists of about 80 different luxury brands. So with LVMH you're getting incredible diversification that spans Sephora and beauty, which is our entry points for luxury and in fact is holding up quite well. DFS, which is another part of their selective retail group. But they have some real winners with Louisville Vuitton and Christian Dior and then they have some more fashion brands like a Kenzo that are more vulnerable to an economy than the LDN, then the Louis Vuitton. And then of course, you have Tiffany's, you have all their jewelry lines.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo what we saw in 2008 and 2009, is that luxury did not go down as low as other categories and it rebounded more quickly than other consumer discretionary categories. And we think that that will be the case again, this, you know, in this current economic environment, and frankly, this environment is nowhere near what 2008 or 2009 was with the Great Recession. Right now, like we're not even sure if we're in a recession, right? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnne Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMarie, yes. So I think we're not sure if we're in a recession now and it's much more about the outlook. You've talked about Asia demand. Let's call it something else geopolitically that's different today versus in 2008 and that's the impact on Russian demand for luxury goods. Talk to us a little bit about what demand from Russia has looked like in the past and where it stands now, given the conflict with Ukraine?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight. So Russia, it is not a support as it was in 2008 or2009. Or, you know, it was part of the picture. But now you have a growing UAE, you have a youth that is entering the luxury market. And so I think that, you know, what's different now is there's more people in the market. We recently presented a Shop talk and in 2000, when we entered this century, 3% of the Chinese were in the middle class, by 2018 53% were. I mean, you have a huge middle class of 700 million people that buy luxury. They may buy low, and they have pent up demand from COVID for the last two years. So that's going to help them this year. The UAE has always sought luxury, but now they're bringing it to their own territory and we see a lot of demand coming there, which will offset the loss of the Russian consumer.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTalk to us a little bit too, Marie, about direct to consumer and how luxury has been able to sell online, you know, you think about the stereotypical luxury experience, it's very much in person, it's tactile, you see the product, you feel the product, you try the product, if you're paying such high prices, has that evolved?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo their pricing is consistent, you know, the luxury brands are going direct to consumer because they can, they're in selected points of distribution where they want to be often they're renting space in a wonderful department store like a Bergdorf Goodman, and Neiman Marcus or Saks Fifth Avenue or Bloomingdale's. But going direct to consumer means that you hope that you have control of your messaging at all points, and your adjacencies.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDuring COVID we saw and we continue to see throughout America, that luxury brands are opening more direct to consumer out physical stores to be where the consumer is because during COVID many consumers moved from metro areas to urban and rural areas. We just did a survey in China and it's more important for the Chinese that they want to discover luxury in physical store locations. And another interesting facet is that they're influenced more by their friends than they are by a KOL. So I urge you folks to check out Coresight’s research and look for our most recent survey on the China luxury consumer. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut so, but direct to consumer is just a way for them to really control what they look like in every point of sale and online. You can get selected products but luxury, is experiential, as you said, and not all the apparel is going to be or the ready to wear, not all the collection is going to be available online. But it's as easy as during COVID the consumers picked up the phone and call their sales associate. And and they were doing one to one selling kind of like one to one live shopping.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMarie, just to finish our conversation, which has been just so interesting. With respect to Hermes and LVMH in particular, can we just go back to something you touched on early, which was the second hand market? We know that both Hermes and LVMH generate about half their revenue from the leather goods category, which is one secondhand market? And then you've got jewelry and others? Can you talk about the second hand appetite for those different product categories?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, so I know better the second hand you know, the RealReal's of the world, the best year collective. A lot of it is the leather goods, you know, if you're a shopper and you love luxury goods and you buy some luxury clothing, you see that it drops, unless it's the most iconic of pieces, it drops in value, like 50 to 80%. The handbags hold their value, as I said before, and you get 80 to 150% of what you pay for. The thing about the secondhand market is that you can attract a new consumer to your brand there. A lot of brands, luxury, contemporary are bringing resale on their own branded platform so that they can keep that connection with the consumer. And there's been advances in technology and tagging so that luxury brands can keep track of who owns their product.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAll this is to say that secondhand is really very viable. A luxury shopper cares about sustainability. And this secondhand is a feature of sustainability. It shows a prolonged life, it validates a purchase and it validates quality, something that has an extended life. An interesting feature that has come out with the recent RealReal report is that consumers are looking for vintage products and they're looking for handbags that are in fair condition, not necessarily in excellent condition because they want a handbag with the patina of use, which is really interesting. They want to look like they've owned this handbag for 10 years not for you know the last month. Interesting, right?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThat is very interesting.\u0026nbsp; And part of my last question, which comes to mind if you can get your crystal ball out for us, Marie, and look at the next six to 12 months out? How do you see that trend evolving? And what are some other evolving consumer and luxury retail trends you can see coming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo I think luxury holds up. I think that, you know, depending on how bad the economy is, you will see an impact. It's more muted in luxury but it you know it does participate in the economy. I think you'll see perhaps people trading into second hand also monetizing what they have in their closet to support their next luxury purchase.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAdditionally, beauty will do well. Beauty has become a form of wellness, it's a form of taking care of oneself. So all the and fragrance has become more important in terms of self expression and taking care of oneself. So I think that we're going to see beauty grow, and you see that caring brings beauty in house. So beauty will become a more important feature of overall luxury and luxury will hold up and luxury has less volatile earnings and they can sooner you know, slow down their manufacturing and again keep their supply demand that equation in balance.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWith that Marie Driscoll thank you so much for joining us Senior Analyst at Coresight Research.

We're going to be covering lots of things from The possible TikTok ban and its potential impact. With us today, once again is Mark Mahaney, senior managing director and head of the internet research team over at Evercore ISI. He is also the author of a new book titled Nothing But Net 10 timeless stop picking lessons from one of Wall Street's top tech analysts and we are doing a book giveaway. So if you want to get your hands on a copy, just send a DM to the public live handle. You see it right there on the top of your screen, folks. All right, it's time to get into it. Hi, Mark. Welcome back to public life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Hey, Kori. Good.

I don't know if you're aware a lot in the financial industry has changed. But today we're gonna focus on the tech stuff and what's happening with TikTok, I mean, the company's CEO, he provided that testimony. He was on Capitol Hill this morning, where he really received some tough, tough criticism with one lawmaker even stating, and I quote, I expect today, you'll say anything to avoid this outcome, but we are not buying it. What were your takeaways from the TikTok CEOs testimony?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e I hope that none of my children ever have to go on the Capitol Hill and testify with the weekend that he had, I wouldn't wish that fate on my greatest enemy. So I'm sorry to carry on being kind of glib about it. But that was, you know, I respect him. And I respect him for going up there and taking that, it's kind of like Zuckerberg, you know, in the last year or two or two years ago, being brought up to Capitol Hill to testify. It's kind of like the leaders of tech being brought up there Bezos and, and Tim Cook, etc, are being brought up to testify that was just unfortunately for TikTok, they're going up against two major issues, social health concerns, related to social media usage. And then much more importantly, these days is national security issues. And so, you know, you knew that the question was just how much defense he could play in that time, and I didn't watchall of the testimony. But that's what I was just struck by and I think maybe more importantly, just today's testimony, the action question for all of us as public market investors because we can't invest in TikTok or, or at least not as a separate standalone asset. I don't think we'll ever see it that way, is what are the implications of this for other social media assets, specifically, Snap, Meta, and Google? And I think the probability of TikTok getting banned in the US is just increasing, you know, relatively materially over the last 12 months. I know there are a lot of constitutional issues around this. And I think they're very serious. But I just think that the odds of some sort of ban or major restriction have increased materially. And so that's kind of a pending catalyst. And anytime the news flow comes up, you'll see names like Snap and Meta outperform on that day, which is what you're seeing today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e You know, I feel what I'm hacking a little bit more in terms of the broader social media context, because you did reference, you know, Zuckerberg having to go up there kind of, you know, defend all the stuff that Facebook, you know, had going on all the negative things specifically, right, that was happening. I mean, you even saw back in the day with Dorsey, he had to go there. Back when he was still leading his company. He co-founded Twitter. I mean, you see it across the board, it doesn't seem to be net like it doesn't seem to be ending anytime soon. And one of my takeaways from what happened today with TikTok, specifically, Mark is that I feel like they're also getting the brunt of all of the aforementioned right, big social media companies. It's like they've had enough time at the batting cage, right? With the Facebooks, with the Googles of the world, with the Snaps that now they're just ready to unleash completely on TikTok.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Kori, I think that's right. But no, but don't forget this. I mean, we got a major political issue, growing political tensions between the US and China. And that's what made this tougher, I think, than anything that the tech companies had to face before because, you know, they,Those are US companies, you know, presenting in front of their elected representatives. That's not the case with TikTok and at the moment when relations between the US and China are at the lowest that they've been and, you know, I'm no expert on that. But um, in some time and maybe decades, so it's just, there's just a lot of different angles here that made it much tougher for TikTok to come through and again, it's kind of hard to see a political out here because it looks to look from where I stand it, it looks like the US military has banned Tiktok from personnel devices, personal and personnel devices. You've had more states do that. You've had a federal government do that you'd like that. That's from government-owned devices. So you've already gotten pretty far down the path here. You've never had that happen with any of the other apps. So and that's not because there's a greater social health issue related to TikTok than there was to Snap or to Facebook. It's because of the Chinese national security issue. So that this is just a bigger, this is just my this is more explosive of an issue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e No, it definitely is something else that you brought up earlier is that you know, you don't think there will ever really see TikTok, as a standalone kind of investable company where people like you or myself, your company would be able to then you know, buy shares in TikTok, it is owned by ByteDance. However, are there some scenarios perhaps in your mind Mark that could play out if TikTok were forced to sell or spin on where it could become, you know, a company at some point that you are I could invest in?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well I don't think so. There was an article in the papers this morning in China that the Chinese government for the first time made an official statement that they would be strongly opposed to a forced sale of TikTok. So I mean, I'm no expert on China, I just assumed that there would be some statement that would come out along the way to this effect. Well, it's out. So I think that's why a ban is such a distinct probability, because I don't think ByteDance will be allowed, even if they wanted to, and I don't think they want to, they wouldn't be allowed to sell TikTok to a US company. So TikTok's in the middle of a geopolitical Firestorm that's, it's unfortunate for them. And you know, I give them all credit. This is a highly innovative company now, whether they actually create a national security risk, that's, you know, there are thorough, thoughtful arguments on that. But anyway, that probably matters. Neither here nor less, it doesn't matter now, Kori, we're not gonna be able to get the chance to invest. So let's focus on the companies that could be derivatives of there. That's Meta. Alphabet because of YouTube and Snap. And I really do think sometimes we spend a little too much time on Snap as a derivative. I think that the use case you know, for those who have used TikTok a lot, you think about what other assets like Snap is more of a communications tool than that kind of leaned forward entertainment tool. That TikTok is but the analogies are really, Instagram and YouTube and those would be the beneficiaries where they were TikTok to be banned.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Okay, that was a foreign mission company is like Google because of YouTube likes Facebook, obviously, also owns Instagram. This is a perfect lead into my next question, because I know over at Evercore, you guys recently hosted a panel with three experts who collectively oversee $1 billion in ad budgets, these are companies that have really been struggling right in the ad space. But the panel revealed some signs that this ad a winter it could be starting to thaw, could you provide some insight into what you're seeing in the ad space, and how we could you know, positively impact some of those other companies that we could invest in?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I think we're still in an ad winter, I think that's what we've uncovered so far with, with the channel checks that we've done, maybe that's not terribly surprising. And, you know, there's a broadening consensus that, that we do have a recession coming. So you know, we could be staying in an ad winter for quite some time. I don't think we're going to see crocus's anytime soon. I think Kori, those are the first plants that show up in the snow out of the snow, but you're also into horticulture Mark, you're a man of many talents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e And somebody can correct me on my pronunciation of crocus's. But, but, but I, I don't, I don't think we're gonna get a quick V shape recovery in marketing spend in advertising spend. And so that's going to be a bit of a drag on some of these names. The advantage and one of the reasons we like Meta frankly, one of the reasons it's our number one recommendation is you don't need to believe that to be long Meta, because they've taken so many of the costs out of their business. And then they've got this new reals, monetization, and they're doing much better targeting than they were years ago. And if you've got this new ad format called click to messaging, click the message which is used much less than the US but it's widely used outside of the US especially in areas of the world like Latin America and parts of Asia. And that's, that's a it's a brand new there's like a product cycle here. You need a product cycle because the overall market is getting soft, and it's not good. It's not firming up yet it's not getting better. And we're still in an ad winter and you know, we should probably assume we're gonna continue to be one for as it's gonna be a long winter it's gonna be several more months at least.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Mark I don't know. I remember you being this type of pessimistic in terms of the ad winter continuing and then you brought up the dreaded R word recession, goodness, a lot of things in what you just said that are very important takeaways. I'm gonna keep it moving, though, because Amazon, this is a company that has been doing a complete like 180 in terms of its firing, it's not doing the speed hiring anymore. They just announced on Monday, they're gonna lay off another 9000 employees. Do you have any thoughts on this mark?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I think the big backdrop here is actually I thought Amazon was the first of the major tech companies to acknowledge that they had over hired overbuilt during the COVID crisis, they said this on their march 22 earnings call that was the that would have been last April, so about a year ago, but then they didn't really act on it. Whereas I think Facebook didn't acknowledge it early, but then they acted on it by laying off a good number of employees. Look, these layoffs are they're no fun for anybody there painful for all people involved. I've gone through it. And, so I wish it on nobody but you know, just as consumer households have to tighten their belts when times get tough. So do corporations, and especially those that over-hired and over-extrapolated from COVID demand trends. And Amazon was one of those, you could actually look they grew their expenses faster than they grew their revenue, and their revenue grew quickly, from 2019 to 2022. So they did overbuilt, they acknowledged it, and they needed to do one or two rounds of cuts, and they've done the two rounds of cuts. As long as we don't go into a steep recession, I don't think they need to do another round of cuts. But doing those cuts was necessary. You also had a bit of a change in but you've had a major change in management over the last two years. It's given a new CEO who's been with the company for 20 years. So he's not new to Amazon by any means. But it gets given them some time to maybe look through all the portfolio of bets, and assets that Amazon hasn't maybe pair some things back maybe not lose $10 billion a year on Alexa, which was a reported number, which was terrifically high. So anyway, I think I think that's kind of what you're getting out of Amazon, which is they're getting deep now into belt-tightening. And I do think that at the end of the day, when we come out of this, and when we get back to more normal economic times, companies are going to be doing this on the lower cost base. And that means you create what I call these EPS slingshot opportunities. So when the revenue recovers on a lower cost base, that means that earnings can grow much faster. And that can be a great long equity opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Let's definitely hope that it will be really quick, Mark, before I get you out of here. I know that you are recently out in Las Vegas for the PROSPER show, which is a gathering of E-commerce sellers and solution providers just really quickly for all the rest of us who were not able to attend the show. What insights did you take away about the Amazon marketplace from that show?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, it's still remarkably a positive experience for most sellers that are on there. And I think you're seeing a lot of them. I guess one of them the most part, the single most interesting takeaway for me was, I think it was 8 out of the 10. Amazon Marketplace, sellers that we spoke to are currently using advertising on Amazon. And Amazon don't tell anybody this but they're generating close to $40 billion a year in advertising revenue, they're going to be the next $100 billion a year ad revenue company. And that's not going to be next year or the year after. But sometime in the next three to five years. They'll be up there. I mean, they're gonna be in spitting distance of Facebook and Google. And because it's a high-intent platform and marketers and advertisers love to be in high-intent platforms. So that was probably the biggest takeaway. Merchants really like advertising on Amazon, watch this space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Wow. Well, the faculty said they're going to be in spitting distance of those big behemoths like Google and Facebook. That's definitely something to watch. As always, we love when you come on Public lot to share your insights. Once again, everyone this is Mark Mahaney, the senior managing director and head of internet research team over at Evercore ISI.

It's called the Solana Saga - big announcement for the company. Solana announced on Thursday that the Saga is now available and will be shipped on the 20th of April for those who pre ordered and open for orders on May 8 for everyone else.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHere to discuss the new phone and really how it might be able to revolutionize web3 itself is Anatoly Yakovenko. He's the co-founder of Solana and CEO of Solana Labs. Anatoly, thanks for being here. Great to have you.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Thank you for having me.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOf course. So let's begin with the most obvious question, at least to me, why the need for something like Saga right now in the marketplace?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWell, if you've ever imagined what crypto should be like, once we actually get to full adoption, you can imagine that world with a phone that's not your hardware wallet, it just makes sense. Right? Like it's the device you use every day, it has all the technology necessary for signing and transactions to be secure. It's just not enabled yet. So myself, I spent most of my career at Qualcomm and some of my closest colleagues worked on the technology that we're using to enable this. They literally built the Snapdragon trust zone. So as soon as I started working on crypto, it was just always in the back of my mind, when are we going to enable this on a Qualcomm device. So I'm pretty excited to actually get this to market and the level of security that this provides, I think, is so close to what a mobile phone could do, in terms of being a hardware wallet. So I'm really excited to bring that to consumers.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd to the point about bringing that to consumers. Talk to me about how you envision this new look, web3 experience to be especially on a device, an Android device and, and something like this for people who have some familiarity, but are pretty eager to learn more.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo we want to get the experience to be as kind of slick and exciting to people as and seamless as what you expect on an Apple Pay, or the Google Wallet. So when you sign transactions, you just tap the fingerprint scanner, and it automatically detects your fingerprint, does a biometric checking inside trusts out in a secure environment, and that signature happens and your transactions go through. The nice thing about doing this in Solana is that it's cheap and fast and it feels like you're using, you know, Google Wallet or Apple Pay as well. So you're own experience is kind of a slow network effect that you do on a theory or other networks.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut there's more. I think one of the fundamental reasons why this is necessary isn't just the security part, it’s actually the applications part of the web3 DAP store that Solana released as well. There's a bit of a fundamental difference with web3 business models, that doesn't really work with web2. When you own web3 content, you actually own it. You own those NFTsYou know, when you own music that you bought from iTunes, you don't actually own that music. It's still Apple, so you can't transfer it. You can't sell it on eBay, right? You can't give it to your kids, in theory. But then NFTs, you can actually own those digital goods. So that just doesn't really quite work with the App Store models, like applications, like magic eaten in their iOS app, they can't list the digital items that are for sale in their marketplace, at 30%. higher price in the iOS App Store because they don't own that content. They can't eat those costs internally. And they can't list it higher because there's no way somebody's gonna pay $30,000 for an NFT in the Apple App Store, if it's available for 10,000 bucks on the desktop, that's just never gonna work.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo there's a bit of a conundrum there. How do we get the app the big app stores to change those policies and to actually re-script to let these new business models, you know, be discovered and for people to figure out how to monetize them in a way that's fair to everyone. So I think we're taking that first step to really enable that for consumers and developers to see what happens.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnatoly, was it always part of your your calculus or your dream to have a separate Solana App Store, especially given how the App Stores of today, Googles and Apples have very strict payment system rules and to your point, one of the big headaches for developers, of course, is this 30% figure and a lot of the rules and regulations under the companies that basically control the market share of the space, at least up until now.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWell, you know, Solana is a platform. It's a platform for developers. So I talked to developers all the time, it's just kind of my day to day, probably half of my day is spent talking to external developers that are building some applications. And I would say their number one concern is how am I going to get these web3 features through the Google approval process for the Apple approval process? So as soon as we started gaining traction with devs, this was always something that they brought up. So immediately it became something that I've kind of always had in the back of my mind.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDo you expect web2 companies to try and do something like this? You did a good job a response or two or go laying out some of their challenges, but is it your expectation that even the web2 kind of legacy names will be forced to sort of adapt?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI would love to work with every web tech company that's thinking about this, and with all the tech we built is open source, we will gladly work with them to do the engineering work for them to start leveraging this platform. That would be awesome.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHave you, if you don't mind me asking, have you had any conversations with any of those names?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNothing deep that we want to announce yet.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOkay. All right. Fair enough. I'm a journalist. I'm just asking the questions I'm sure you understand.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, give me your sense. Give me your sense about why this has not yet been done already and why is Solana the right foundation for mobile, and of course your for more mainstream adoption?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI mean, it's probably because I'm the founder that worked at Qualcomm for over a decade. So I knew exactly what pieces of technology we needed to build to ship this. So it didn't take a 100 person team. It was a very small team of labs, you know, I think about five to seven engineers that we got the ball rolling to get this out.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd Solana the network is really well suited for the mobile experience, users really can't wait, you know, 10, 20, 30 seconds, let alone minutes for transactions to settle. That has to happen within one to two seconds, and it has to be so cheap that for the mobile experience, developers can actually pay for the user.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo if the unit economics for using these web3 applications have to be so low that you can start doing the same kind of adoption, you know, product market fit loops that you see on mobile applications today. And that means users don't actually care about what network it’s running in- they don't deal with gas costs. And all that stuff is kind of hidden behind the scenes for them. And for that to be possible, the network has to be cheap, as fast as to be scalable. I think Solana is the only one that really fits that bill right now.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAny close competitors you have who might launch a competing phone or something like that, not even on your radar just yet.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, it's not even on my radar. Anonymously, everything we built is open source. I think we would love to get contributions from anyone on the Ethereum community or Bitcoin community to add support for those networks.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhenever you talk about mobile pay operations, this opens the doors to a conversation for general security questions, security concerns. Talk to me about the assurances, and really the work that you and your team have had to do with regards to privacy considerations, especially for any person out there who might consider getting involved, but say, hey, when it comes to mobile pay operations, you're really dealing with some pretty intimate personal information.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo as everybody knows, public permissionless networks are public by default. So any transactions that you do are recorded in a public ledger. So this is something that folks need to be mindful of. And there are technologies to make transactions more private, like elusive is a technology that does as your knowledge proof when you want to do transfers and things like that. So you would have to intentionally use those technologies. And because all of those are available as smart contracts, it is really outside of the hardware wallets kind of domain to take care of the wallet, the only thing that it provides is the secure signing capability. But everything else you can basically access via smart contracts.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHow many pre orders do you have on the phone? What does interest look like?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBefore we launched, we had about I think 5,000 pre orders, we were targeting developers and from my perspective, it was..our DBT units that we shipped are very well received. So we have a very excited developer community that loves the device.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo it sounds like that was largely your expectation about that 5,000 number. And again, keep in mind, it's early, right? We're not even quite yet at the shipping distribution phase of it, but you get the sense that that largely matches the excitement you had hoped for for people?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Yeah, so the thing is that like, I've worked on every major phone launch at Qualcomm, like as an engineer, remember the Amazon Fire the Metro phone from Microsoft. It's very, very hard to launch a phone with a million units sold on day one. And this is actually I think ..this was never our time, when you look at daily active users on\u0026nbsp; the most popular web3, networks like applications like OpenSea, it's about 10 to 20,000 people that generate 20 to $30 million of volume per day. So our goal is to actually get the most heavy web3 users on this device. And because there's no restrictions for web3 content on this device, that's a better distribution channel. If you can target those 10 to 20,000 users directly as an app developer, that's a much better distribution channel than the big app stores because of the restrictions. So that's really what matters. Can we get the right users?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd how about targeting users that may not yet be too involved with the web3 space? I think at this point, most people, if not everyone has heard of it. But as you know, not everyone has necessarily felt confident as of yet to dip their toe into the market. You do a great job laying out the case, I would argue in terms of going to that core constituency that you know, we'll be supportive. I think your pre-order numbers suggest that, but how about other people that are sort of on the sidelines? Is this something they might be able to consider, if not now, for potential future application?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThis is an awesome Android device on its own. It's built by an amazing company, the founder literally designed the iPad Pro. I mean, like when I worked at Qualcomm, and I would compare the phones that we had to iPhones and I was always like, why can't we have nice things. This is like the first phone that I feel like the build quality is better than Apple’s.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo I would suggest that anyone that's like, loves phones and wants to check out Android, we've literally I think the first time that I've ever seen people tweet on Twitter, I'm going to switch from iPhone to an Android device because of this. So I would genuinely recommend that people go check it out simply because it's an awesome phone. And then maybe if they're curious about crypto, check out those features too.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnything like this is undoubtedly a huge labor of love. Talk to me personally, what most excites you? I can only imagine here, right, but just covering enterprise and covering big companies, and covering people with big ideas for a living. There's such an emotional part about this. It's such a deeply personal thing you and your colleagues are undoubtedly pouring all of yourselves into this. What most excites you personally about this, that you would want someone watching this interview to take away?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOh, man, yeah, we literally call it chewing glass. But the process of launching a product like this, we had to chew a lot of glass. What I love about it is I think all the ideas that we have, and all the dreams that we have about having this like full web3 adoption with privacy, and people with self custody, having full control of their funds, of their digital content, it's all kind of coming together. And it’s all.. the technology is there. It's possible, and the user experiences can be wonderful. It could be joyful, right? You're using Apple Pay or any other Google Wallet experiences, but now for crypto.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo that to me is really, really exciting. And I want to see people that are so excited about the applications that this is the best reason that they get this phone. They're not just curious, but they actually see somebody that built something that gives them so much value that they want to go get this phone and then enjoy that.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI mean, you work in this space, you're on Twitter as much as I am, if not more - so you know, web3 has its fair share of critics. What do you say to people that may still be on the outside and not they're not on the outside, because they just haven't learned enough to get involved, they're on the outside because they have learned a lot and they are firmly in the camp of being adversarial to a lot of the efforts that you're describing?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI think their skepticism is very warranted and welcome. And I think it's going to take a lot of work for us to prove that there is real value here. And I think that's very fair to say, like we haven't yet seen an application and crypto in web3, that has broken out to consumer success that everyone's using it on a day to day basis.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo we're trying to kind of like remove all the speed bumps for developers to get there. And that's a lot of work in and of itself. But I firmly believe in the idea of self custody, that you own these cryptographic keys that are secured with math, and that gives you tremendous power to transact and coordinate with people online. It's a very powerful thing – it expands to human human rights, right? That's maybe a bit too much. There's much bigger problems in the world, but it does empower people to go do really cool things on the internet, so I think that's awesome and I'm excited to see the kinds of applications people build.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd then talk to me a bit more about especially for people that are kind of accustomed to having a more traditional provider, let's say an AT\u0026amp;T or Verizon - what does this look like specifically with Helium 5G? First, a lot of mobile, especially if you're introducing some names that some people, not all of your demographic base, of course, but some people are only really learning about for the first time.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e I mean, if you're a wireless network nerd, this has got to be the coolest thing ever. Because, you know, all these massive networks, they're effectively almost like government mandated monopolies. These are very big companies. They require licensing from the FCC and a lot of work and deployment to go build, build these towers and deploy these towers and everything. And Helium is doing it from the ground up, basically volunteer driven, and people are doing it for tokens, which are like, you know, more or less doing it for fun, right? They want to see if this will actually work. And I believe Helium was at about 8,000 5G cells, and these are like four GCB, you know, 4G+ CBRS spectrum band cells, similar to what other folks call 5G as well. If you want to get technical, there's a bunch of differences, but it's a high quality network at like 8,000 cells. AT\u0026amp;T and Verizon, I think are about 50,000 cells.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe United States probably needs like a million. These are the estimates that I've seen before people talk about online. Some will say as high as 10 million to really get wall to wall coverage. So there's a lot of work left to do for the big carriers. And I think there's a very good chance that Helium passes them. And like overtakes and is maybe the first one to actually get to that, you know, 500,000 or a million number of like 5G cells in the United States. And that would be awesome. That means a bunch of volunteers coordinating with cryptography, right? Just with a bunch of math on a public blockchain, we're able to outpace in very critical infrastructure for United States for communication. I think that would be the coolest thing that's ever happened, I think in technology.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou told me earlier about the number of pre orders. Are you able to give me a sense about your own internal projections? How many of these are you hoping to sell? And what does that kind of long term base case look like?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI would be super happy if we get 25,000 hardcore users that love this device. To me that's like, that's something that I know, developers that I talked to, would find very compelling as a distribution channel. And that's a good enough start. Obviously, it would be amazing if we were 10x that. And that would be awesome, but we'll see what happens. It's very hard to build phones, we build a really great device. But you know, it's very, very hard to sell phones. It's a very competitive market. So we'll see what happens. Startups are here to take big swings and take risk. That's what we're doing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, my man, you got to take big swings, you're swinging for the fences out there. If it were easy to develop a phone, truly everyone would do it, and there's a reason so few are. Finally, what would you most want either anything we didn't directly talk about or anything that kind of keeps you up that you would most want people to know about this new iteration for you and the company?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThis is a work of love from Solana labs, and another startup Awesome Privacy, that have really poured their heart into the hardware and the software. I really want people to go check it out and really just go see if they can enjoy the experiences that we've built for them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnatoly Yakovenko is the co-founder of Solana and the CEO of Solana labs.

I'm your host Connor Round and I'm so happy to be here with you today to discuss the key themes in AI and the industries that it can bring innovation and growth to. I'm thrilled to welcome my guest today, Ivana Delevska, Founder and Chief Investment Officer at Spear Invest.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThanks for having me, Connor.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor Round: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo just to start off, you know, we're here to talk about artificial intelligence. It's an opportunity that has use cases beyond the human imagination. So just to start off when considering business applications of AI, could you help investors understand what industries and sectors you see greatly benefit from the innovations in the space?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYes, sounds great. Connor so many people under appreciate the fact that AI today is already a $100 billion industry and it's still in the very early innings. The main applications that we see it used in today would be for consumer technologies. So it would be for like recommenders in cases like TikTok or e-commerce where you're getting recommended products to buy. So that's one of the largest applications that we see today. But looking forward, we think AI will be transformational for many industries, traditionally industrials, automotive, life sciences. We think it's really going to have a transformative impact for the broader industrial complex.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eVery interesting. And could you just break down the AI capabilities that you see within the social media space?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWell, yeah, so it's interesting social media. Previously, all of the innovation or all of the use cases in AI were based on this recommender model. So basically, companies like TikTok would in-house train their their models to be able to tell based on few data points on videos that you watch, they're going to be able to form a whole profile about you, and then be able to, to recommend you other videos, and they can be really addictive as most people, most people have seen.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo that's kind of the main use case today. Now, the new thing in AI is this transformer model, which was the concept or the paper was written and introduced in 2016. But you've really seen these models just getting trained, these large language models. So Chat GPT, is one application of this large language model, it's based on a model called GPT 3 that was introduced in 2021. So a lot of people are excited about the applications of Chat GPT today, but I will highlight that this is just one kind of flavor of the opportunity that we see going forward.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat, I'm actually happy you brought up chat GPT that was just gonna go right into that. Apart from it kind of just expanding and, you know, breaking out into the scene very quickly. How do you see other companies reacting in the space? Do you see Google coming out with a new search engine capability? I'd love to hear your opinion on that.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, so we see Microsoft and Google, as potentially being leaders on the language side, Microsoft has maybe a head start, they've invested quite a bit here. And we've seen quite a lot from them. They're behind the GPT 3 language model, but they also recently announced an even newer model with even more parameters, 530 billion parameters, so we're gonna see a lot more from them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGoogle has been pretty quiet. They were maybe the leader several years ago. So we are waiting to hear what's going to come out of them. Investors believe that they have something, but it's kind of TBD. So as of right now, those are the two that are going to be leaders in the lead on the language model side. But it's very important for investors to realize that when you invest, you don't necessarily just want the direct beneficiary over trend, there is going to be a lot of investment in the infrastructure beyond behind like, behind AI. So for Microsoft, it's not just on the Bing side that they can introduce Chat GPT and kind of help jumpstart their business, but they're really going to benefit on the cloud side as well. So from an investment perspective, right now, we're finding better risk rewards in investing in the infrastructure. So it would be semiconductors, cloud infrastructure, and cybersecurity as well. So yeah, so basically, the point here is beware of value traps, right? You don't want to invest in something that will get competed away.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, definitely. And just to keep on Chat GPT, a lot of the hype has brought excitement to firms. And it kind of seems to be a similar trend to that of the crypto boom in 2021, with BuzzFeed announcing Chat GPT similar implications. Just wanted to know, do you see this as maybe a trend that will die down? Or is this something that we can expect to last?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWell ChatGPT specifically, what you will need to see is people building things that are going to be useful on it. So specifically, for us, we're looking for maybe broader opportunities than that. But AI is a trend that is definitely not going to die down. As I mentioned before, it's already a $100 billion dollar industry. So whether Chat GPT takes off or not, it’s not really going to have..it will have some implications on AI but it's not really going to have broad implications for AI, if that makes sense.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDefinitely and as you said, it is a $100 billion industry already. But in order to rev up innovation in this space further, much hardware and infrastructure will be required, such as the need for, you know, the much reliance semiconductor industry.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhat types of semiconductors, so we could just help investors understand, are required for building out AI, and how much of the industry is dedicated to its face?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYes, so, so thanks for asking that question, Connor. So basically, in order to train these models, you need GPUs. And that's why companies like Nvidia produce these today. And basically GPUs allow computers to do parallel operations and the reason why people are all of a sudden so excited about AI versus say a year or two ago is that prior to the transformer model, and prior to this language, first language models, trained AI will just be able to do prescriptive tasks. So, if you give it a bunch of images, it can learn what you're showing it, right? So it wouldn't necessarily be able to put things into context or draw its own conclusions. So in order to be able to put things into context and draw its own conclusions, the model sizes have increased exponentially. So maybe five years ago, in 2018, the model sizes would have been less than 100 million parameters. Today, these models that are trained and deployed are over over 500 billion parameters. So the amount of GPUs that are required for this is exponential.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat, and what players in the space do you see benefiting from increased demand for AI related chips such as GPUs?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e So in video is gonna be a big beneficiary full disclosure, we all not only video stock, and we disclose all of our holdings on our website, but then you may be able to see the reason why Nvidia is such a beneficiary is because they came up with this CUDA architecture that is free for people to use. So if you want to build something on AI, all you need to do is buy the NVIDIA hardware, and then you can use these frameworks for free. Other companies are not there yet. So you could still buy GPUs from AMD. But then what do you do with them? But over time, as the industry develops, there is likely going to be other solutions, and maybe some of these other companies that are developing GPUs will benefit.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnother area we really like that is not doing very well right now, is cloud infrastructure. So a lot of the cloud names are getting hit pretty hard, because of enterprise spending cuts. So this is a sector that hasn't really done that well in this recent bounce, this year. Nvidia is already up quite a bit here today, but the cloud cloud names have really not performed in line, so we like that. And then as you deploy AI, you're going to have a lot more vulnerabilities so you're going to need newer cybersecurity solutions. So this is another area where we find a lot of opportunities – basically how do you secure? How do you secure these AI workloads? And how do you secure eight edge computing?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat, so a lot of industries that are going to see some upside there and those segments, but the industry has struggled with keeping up with shift demand through supply chain constraints, severely dealing with shortages throughout the years of 2021 and 2022. If AI demand gears up in the near future, will semiconductor firms be able to manage their supply chains to keep up with demand trends?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo we see a lot of supply actually getting added over the next two to three years. So we think there is going to be plenty of supply of chips available. And just to explain how this works, basically companies like Nvidia and AMD, they don't manufacture the chips, but they just design them and then foundries like TSMC will do the actual manufacturing. So we're seeing - this is a pretty big trend actually that's supporting even broader economic activity in the U.S. are these large CapEx investments by the foundries or the large chip manufacturers like TSMC. Intel as well has expansion plans. So there's going to be plenty of supply, we believe to meet the demand.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat And just lastly, could you just break down the traditional segments of the semiconductor space? What spaces or segments do you see slowing down? And are there any other ones that you see an opportunity, and I know that you named a few, but if you just break them down for investors to understand a little bit more, I think that'd be fantastic. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, absolutely. So basically the big separation is between consumer and data center. So, if you look at, for example, TSMC, revenues would be like half consumer, like a very high level, half consumer half data center. So consumer would be used in PCs, smartphones, and then on the data center side, this would be like cloud, cloud vendors, and in any sort of enterprise computing. And then within the data center segment, we're seeing slowdown across the board. So the consumer got pretty hard hit at the beginning of last year, PC demand has been significantly down but the way semis work is usually there is a lot of inventory in the system. So what the manufacturers or designers see is a lot worse than what in demand looks like.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo as inventory stabilizes, TSMC said that they're expecting it to stabilize at the beginning of this year, and to see pick up in the second half of next year. And then similarly, on the data center side, that segment just started seeing some weakness, but we believe that the high performance computing, which is what we talked about with Nvidia, like the chips that are required for AI, we expect those will hold up better.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor Round: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat.

Happy Wednesday and welcome once again to Views from Space where we dive into the space economy and where it's headed. This is part of a monthly series presented by Terran Orbital, a manufacturer of small satellites.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI'm your host Kinsey Grant, and I am so excited to dive into our topics today, as the live title will suggest we have some big ones coming up Deep Space, Mars, Milani, all sorts of great new tech that we're going to be talking about today with our fantastic guests who I'm going to introduce right now. We have Margarita Cardi who is the VP of Programs at Tyvak International, which is the International segment of Terran Orbital, and also with us Franco Perez Lissi, the systems engineer at the European Space Agency. Franco, Margherita, welcome to Public Live. I'm so excited to have you here with us today. How are you doing?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFranco Perez Lissi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGood afternoon. All good. How are you doing?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMargherita Cardi\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e: Hi, everybody - Margherita here.\u0026nbsp; Thanks for the invite and it’s evening here but good afternoon to you guys.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, isn't that funny how that works. I'm actually in Los Angeles right now so it's morning here, evening there but you know what? Space – there’s never a bad time to talk about it. So let's dive in. Are you guys ready to get to some big questions today?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMargherita Cardi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAbsolutely.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFranco Perez Lissi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, let's go. Right.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAll right, great. So I want to start here, with getting a better understanding of what we're going to talk about today, setting the groundwork, and understanding the important context. Space as a topic is I would say often rife with a lot of mystique and, and a lot of fascination that goes along with that. Now in your work developing small satellites Margherita, you are working to make space more accessible and especially when we're talking about making space more accessible, we're talking about deep space.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo for our listeners, knowing that this is part of space that's well beyond the Earth's atmosphere, with an emphasis on the area beyond the Earth Moon system, I would love it if you could just walk our audience through a quick rundown of what you think makes deep space so appealing. And I think appealing in a lot of ways, you know, appealing from just a general interest standpoint, but also appealing as a satellite developer or for a scientific researcher, what makes deep space so interesting to you, Margherita?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMargherita Cardi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, thanks for the question. It is a very nice one. And I have to say that, at the moment, let's say, we are pretty, you know, conscious about the Earth orbit so the Leo and the orbit around Earth, are environments that are quite well known, I would say, at this moment, while the deep space environment is kind of unexplored, or, let's say less explored, this makes this you know, fascinating for the human being in general. And, and of course, the other aspect that I love about this environment is that we are targeting, you know, bodies, planets, asteroids, on whatever that are not really known in terms of structure and also visual impact.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo the fact is that even if we have some very good assets on the ground that can, you know, do amazing pictures and amazing inspection of some bodies, just when you just get close to that you can really understand what it looks like, in reality. And so this is something that is really fascinating for me personally, but I think that is the driver, you know, for all the people working in the space environment and targeting, you know, the deep space. So there's a, you know, very far away environment with bodies that we really don't don't know yet. And so even in our mission, which we will go to dive a little bit in detail, we are going to a body that we don't really know about, right? So that's the mystery of discovering something new and, and we don't know what to expect. So with that there is like the mystery of that which is driving our, our work and our let's say the way to do satellites to explore this kind of environment.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah. Yeah. Really interesting. And I think that your focus here on trying to know the unknown is certainly going to be a recurring theme that I'm sure we encounter today as we talk Talk about deep space. Franco, I'm curious if you have anything to add about why you think deep space is so interesting and so attractive and intriguing for both people who are just interested in space and also for the Science and Technology communities?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFranco Perez Lissi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, sure. So thanks very much. Similar to Margherita, I think I had always the interest and ambition to go beyond Earth since we know little about it, which makes it more appealing. And I think the amount of science and technology demonstration potential on this planetary bodies is very large. So we're going beyond Earth, in many cases to study planets or objects of our solar system that could also explain the origin of our universe, and that's making it super cool.\u0026nbsp; I mean, by investigating Mars, we can extract information about how the Earth was or how it will be millions of years. So for instance, we studied the core of asteroids as the one things we’re going to do on our mission, and we could understand the millions of millions of years of history before our universe. So for the mission that we're working on, we're going into deep space with a different objective, we're going there to support the protection of our Earth in case of a closer encounter with a potentially dangerous asteroid. So in this situation, hypothetical by now, we need to deviate the trajectory of an asteroid way before it arrives, two years before. We need to go as far as possible to avoid collision with earth and study these bodies in detail, of course, to get all the tools required. So for me there are planetary defense technology, and scientific interests ongoing. So it's a little bit of a combination.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, that's really interesting to consider how understanding our past and our origins might help us to be better equipped to handle whatever comes in the future. I find that to just be endlessly fascinating. Now, with both of these answers in mind, I would love it if the two of you could explain a little bit how satellites come into play here.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo what are some of the use cases for satellites navigating deep space? And I think this would be a great time to talk about some of the focus areas that both of you have and the work that you're doing within the satellite ecosystem. So tell me a little bit about how satellites play into our strategy for exploring deep space – and both of you can feel free to chime in here and share whatever comes to mind.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMargherita, would you like to kick us off?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMargherita: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYes, sure. So coming to the, let's say, the technology area, of course, as I was saying before\u0026nbsp; the space is kind of a different environment with respect to the Earth orbits, and there are a few things that I would like to stress and to focus on a little bit because these environmental impacts on the design of the spacecraft for a few things, which are crucial. So for the first place, I would say that the radiation environment is different. So let's say in the, in the Deep Space, and in general, out of the atmosphere, there is a radiative environment, which is very peculiar, and it's different with respect to you know, the distance from Earth and from the sun, etc. And so, in the Milan emission, for example, and in the asteroid environment, we have a very peculiar environment, and we have to make sure that our technology, and our systems are able to survive this kind of environment. So, of course, there are some methods in order to ensure that and we are executing an extensive edition campaign on some of the crucial modules of the spacecraft so that we can, you know, try to reproduce on Earth what we will be seeing during the mission. It's not, let's say possible to have a match one to one, but in general, we can have some models that allow us to replicate the environment.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd so, thanks to this test, we are able to understand how the systems are responding to the relative environment and so, to be able to implement any mitigation action that we can actually implement on ground before the mission. So, I would say that ideation is one of the main topics that we are focusing on on Milani as well as the navigation because again, we are not in the Earth orbit. So we cannot rely on, you know, existing assets such as the GPS, for example. So, we have to rely on different methods of navigation with which combined to the distance from the Earth. It makes the world aggregation approach pretty peculiar and complex, I would say. So, we have to implement systems that allow us to navigate in such a far and unknown environment and this is kind of something that is putting challenges in our development.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd in this particular mission, in addition to that, the results are another constraint that We have to consider is that the Milani satellite that we are developing as part of the head of mission will not have the capability to directly communicate with Earth. So, we have to rely on the Hara mothercraft for the communication. So, there is a so-called inter-satellite link system that is allowing Milani and Hara to communicate. And then Hara will be, you know, the main bridge to Earth to download the data and the scientific measurements. So, I would say these three things, at least from the Milani point of view, and then we will see what Frank was saying about the overall mission. But these three challenges are the ones that at the moment are really, you know, adding challenges and pushing the development to a more extreme, let's say level, I would say.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight, right. I imagine that that tremendously complicates things. And I would love to dig in a little bit more to this Milani mission, the Milani CubeSat mission. Franco, if you don't mind, could you tell us a little bit about the purpose of the mission? What are the scientific objectives for the Milani mission?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFranco Perez Lissi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, for sure. So, the main scientific objectives of the mission are mainly related to characterize the binary asteroid surface of Deimos, you see now a hyperspectral camera on board a CubeSat. So, the size objectives are split in three. So, the first one is to map the composition of the Deimos, just to understand, which is the content inside the asteroid to be able to respond. As I said before, if an asteroid is coming to the earth, we need to hit it, we need to change the trajectory. So we need to understand first, the materials and what we're finding when we get there, that is determining the mineral composition difference between the two objects.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI mentioned that this is a binary asteroid, a binary means that probably there is a main body and then there is a small asteroid orbiting around the main body as a moon. So we need to determine if there are differences in mineral composition. And also determine the surface roughness and regolith grain size, what we call the surface made out of boulders, it's compact material, etc. So that will give us a good understanding of how strong we need to hit the Astro, for instance, to change the trajectory, and so on.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo mainly you are familiar with the dark mission that our mission was a NASA mission that was launched a few months ago, and also a few months ago, it impacted the moon. So this mission was demonstrating the first step of the whole space safety program, which was hitting the asteroid and now characterizing what is the aftermath of this technology, right? So this is when Milani will come into play. So basically Milani, once we arrive with the main spacecraft, Milani will be deployed in the asteroid vicinity, we will be flying around the asteroid and take your images in different spectral ranges to understand all these objectives that we mentioned before.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, it really is fascinating stuff and I appreciate all the context here and explaining the, you know, real world real life use cases for all this that’s happening. I know that for a lot of people out there, myself included, it can be difficult to completely understand the scope of some of these projects that are happening in deep space. So I appreciate the attention to detail and helping me understand them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNow, I would love to transition here for a minute to talk about the big picture relationships that make all this happen. We were talking here about the Milani mission, this is a collaboration between your two organizations. And I understand that for much of our modern history, when it comes to space exploration, we hear about competing ambitions from different nations, you know, it's one nation trying to beat another to a certain space milestone. But I understand now that it comes down to a lot more collaboration than that when we're talking about real space exploration and real, you know, major innovation in space, in deep space. So tell me a little bit about how that has worked, you know, this collaboration between Tyvak and with the ESA, tell me how these relationships have evolved to be a little bit more global, as we tried to navigate what comes next and what we need to do next when it pertains to deep space?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMargherita Cardi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSure, I can start answering the question, if you don't mind. So, from my perspective, I have to say that I need to take a little step back in the sense that in Europe, let's say in the last, I would say 10 or 20 years, I'd say that the space environment has been evolving a lot. So historically, there were you know, big space companies, which were you know, getting the majority of the industry at the end on the market and say in the last decades, these small companies, let's say small space companies started to grow, and to have the place, you know, in Europe and and now we can demonstrate that also the medium company as we are, can really do a lot of things for the Europe and for the European Space Agency in general. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe example of Tyvak International is pretty useful to understand this trend, because we were born in 2016 and we were just, you know, three or four employees and now we count 50 people and we grew organically in the European ecosystem I would say of companies, and all our employees are from Europe. Actually, most of them are Italian at the end. And our supply chain is mostly European and Italian. And so we are actually bringing value to the European ecosystem. And, this program demonstrates that, you know, small companies as we are can act as prime contractors. So for Milani, we act as the prime contractor for the European Space Agency, and so we had this amazing opportunity three years ago to start this very challenging project and for which I will never stop to thank ESA for this opportunity because now this is possible.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd it's happening more and more in different projects and, of course, Italy, as always plays a good role, because of course, we have one of the main contributors to the space ecosystem in Europe. And again, working on this program and on other programs that we did in the past it’s challenging and it’s of course having a, you know, a very demanding customer. But I also found in the ESA team, you know, very pragmatic people very prepared, and so the collaboration between the two teams is amazing for this project in particular, I will never stop saying that, you know, the relationship and the collaboration and the pragmatic approach, when everything happens is is really is really awesome. I would say I have never seen something like that before and I'm pretty grateful for that, in this occasion. So that gives me the opportunity to thank again, ESA for that and saying that as my example, I mean, our example as a small company in Italy, working on these small satellites, you know, we demonstrated that we can do more, and we will be growing in the in the future, let's say.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, very, very interesting to hear that. And I think that you know, Margherita, it's very obvious and hearing that answer that collaboration is an enormous part of what both of your companies are doing or both of your organizations are doing. So I appreciate you sharing that. Now finally, to close out today, we'd like to do a little myth busting to talk about some of the biggest myths or misconceptions about space.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd today we'll talk about Deep Space, particularly, but I'd love to ask both of you. Do you have any misconceptions about the space industry that you want to reset the narrative or set the record straight? Anything that you think people get wrong about space that you would like to set them right off? Franco, would love to kick off here with you anything you want.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFranco Perez Lissi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWell, so I'm not sure if it misconceptions, but I think probably there are many aspects of Space Science or space technology that people tend to underestimate because probably they don't understand how complex they are. And I would like to focus on two probably two aspects. So the first one is the space environment. So Margherita was mentioning it before a little bit, but within the low earth orbit, when we are close to the Earth, we are protected by the magnetosphere which protects the Earth from high energy particles. Therefore the environment is more, let's say, adequate for satellites. But when we go beyond, and also that applies also for human spaceflight, so when when astronauts go beyond, things are starting to get a little bit more complex because we don't have that protection of the earth Magnetosphere, and we start interacting with particles that can hit our electronics, deposit a lot of energy and create like break the electronics or create overcurrent over voltages etc. So there is a large complexity in designing and mission that goes beyond, not only because we're going far from the earth and the communications are harder and so on, but also because of the environment.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd the second topic that I would like to also highlight is people usually tend to underestimate the complexity of how hard it is to navigate in space. So we don't have GPS or we don't have our iPhones or Android phones with Google Maps there. But what we have is the stars, and we have the knowledge of our position in the universe so that what we call G and C is guidance, navigation and control of the spacecraft is one of the most complex disciplines. And it's amazing how we can actually help the NASA Dark mission there. So basically, we launch a rocket from the earth, and we can hit an object with an accuracy that is amazing. And that object is probably 200 Million (kilometers) away from Earth.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo that is something that I think people tend to underestimate and how complex it is to hit that target from 200 million kilometers away. So these two aspects for me are things that usually I get questions about. And I think Tyvak is doing an amazing job on both domains, so on the radiation on the environment, etc, designing a robust mission, but also on the guidance and navigation and control to navigate the cube sat around around the authoring system.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, absolutely and I appreciate you sharing that. Margherita, anything you would like to add here?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMargherita Cardi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMaybe just a couple of more generic points, of course, I fully agree with what Franco said. And maybe something that also people tend to not really fully understand because they are not working on them on this domain is that, you know, space is useless, and there are a lot of problems on the earth so we are wasting money and time working on space missions. And, you know, this is this is, this is a common feeling for people that are not working on the domain. And I would say that, you know, that's not fully true. And in the sense that working on the space, as demonstrating to have a social return, you know, of investment and competencies and knowledge also for on more ground application, I would say.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo based on the different domains and applications, this is kind of something that is now demonstrated. So this is one of the topics that I encounter more and more when I deal with this kind of discussion, having dinner with friends that are not doing this job. And so this is one of the things that I keep stressing with these people that are more external to the space environment, and also that the space, you know, it's accessible to very few people. And it's something that is, again, not accessible. And, again, we spoke about that at the beginning of this half- hour together. But we demonstrated that this is not true anymore. And small satellites, more launchers have opened a big door to space to basically everyone. So I appreciate it's like a complex domain. But you know, the doors now are open to everybody. And so this was not like that 10s of years ago, but now, with the new space economy, this is starting to be a reality. And so everybody can really access space, if they want. So I will say these two topics are our most of the discussion that I have with, you know, people that are not working in this domain.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Yeah, I appreciate that context, too. And I think that one of the big lessons or takeaways here that I've had from this conversation is understanding that so much of what is going on in deep space really can have implications and impacts on the way that we go about living here on Earth, and I think that that's really, really interesting.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo with that, I would love to thank both of you, Margherita and Franco for joining us today. Once again, Margherita is the VP of programs at Tyvak international Franco is a Systems Engineer at the European Space Agency. And I would love to thank you both for your time and for joining me here today. I learned so much.

An IPO expert weighs in on how the market for newly-public companies could play out in 2023.","transcript":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHello, everybody and welcome to Public Live. I'm your host Ann Berry. Last year in 2022 only 71 companies IPO’d or went public, much lower a comparison with the 2021 surge of new listings. Since IPOs tend to represent a growth investing opportunity and untested companies, market optimism can play a big role in how IPOs are timed and ultimately received by the market.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eFollowing the optimism of 2021 and the volatility of 2022, let's unpack what experts predict could be in store for the IPO market or Initial Public Offering market in 2023. Our guest today is Nick Einhorn the Vice President of Research at Renaissance Capital, which issues the dollar IPO ETF, the only ETF focusing exclusively on the U.S. IPO market. It does so by providing investors with access to U.S. listed newly public company stocks in one security. Nick, welcome to Public Live.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThanks. Thanks for having me.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNick, great to have you. Let's jump right on in and just unpack some of the stats together. Last year 2022 had a historically low rate of IPOs, so 71, to be exact. And with anything, but especially when it comes to investing, context is key. So I'd love it if you could walk us in the community through some of the challenges that companies were seeing in 2022 and what changed relative to that peaky period of 2021.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight, so as you say, a lot depends on what happened in 2020, 2021. Really the surge we saw in the markets, but especially in high growth tech stocks, for example, other riskier stocks, riskier assets, how much excitement there was around those and those years, and that drove a lot of the boom of 2021 IPO issuance. We had almost 400 U.S. IPOs, which is the highest it's been since the internet bubble 2000. And then really, things have flipped or flipped around in 2022. Largely because performance started to drop off towards the end of 2022..or sorry, towards the end of 2021 for those high multiple stocks. A lot of the sectors that had surged during 2021 started to turn around, and really started falling throughout all of 2022 and some of that was fears about recessions, the Fed raising interest rates, the war in Ukraine certainly contributed.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd so there's kind of a perfect storm of stocks starting to fall. And the new issues that did come out in 2022 didn't perform well, and so that caused investors to lose interest in the IPO market or stay on the sidelines. And so, at the same time, companies were hesitant to come public in that kind of environment, so a lot of them put their plans on hold, and ended up sitting out the year. So that kind of really just led to, like you said, only around 70 IPOs, which is the lowest number we've seen in the 30 years we've been tracking the IPO market in the U.S.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd you use that dreaded word bubble right to describe some of 2021 and some of the going public activity then. But when we look in 2022 and the companies that did make it out into the public market, were there any things that those companies had in common? Where were they from specific sectors or stages of maturity, or specific industries? Was there something that enabled those that did go public to make it through the process?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, a lot of them were more mature companies, so less risky than your typical IPO. For example, we saw some large spin offs. Corebridge, which was the spin off of the insurance company AIG, Mobileye, a spinoff from Intel, so businesses that were well known by investors already from being part of large public companies. So that was one area, we saw some strength in specific sectors like energy. Given that energy prices were strong last year, we did see a few energy IPOs come out.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWe continue to see biotech issuance just because those are companies that really are more than most companies, need the cash from an IPO to fund drug development. So some of those may have preferred to wait too, for a better environment that you needed the cash to fund their trials. And, yeah, where we really saw the biggest drop off was in, you know, traditional VC backed tech, internet companies, software companies, and then some of the large LBOs. I think we saw no private equity backed IPOs last year, which was a fairly astounding fact.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWe kind of saw the opposite,,some take privates, right, because instead of taking public companies private instead.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, definitely. I mean, you know, those private equity investors will look to where the sentiment is. And it saw last year, certainly later in the year, especially as a buying opportunity, given all the stocks that had been had come down a lot in price. And so, you know, I'm sure they're hoping that they're going to start seeing improvement in the market soon as they can take those public again.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNick, it's so great to have some of the context that you've provided. Let's shift now to how you and your colleagues at Renaissance Capital are thinking about what's ahead for the IPO market this year in 2023. Do you think we're going to see a flat year relative to 2022? Up, down directionally where are you thinking we're heading?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo our view is that obviously a lot will depend on what happens in the broader markets. But our basic expectation is that things will improve from 2022. But it will be gradual over the course of the year. And we won't get back to kind of normal levels of issuance until late in the year. Certainly, if not, you know, and maybe not even until next year, but we're hoping kind of later this year. And a lot is going to depend again, if the, you know, we want to see the broader market stabilizing, hopefully, the recession fears cool a bit. And we do see kind of a little more, some of the investor confidence come back into some of the sectors that have been the most hurt during the downturn.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut one thing we've learned from historical study of the IPO market is that periods of slow issuance often tends to produce strong IPO returns. A little counterintuitively, but it's really just because in the slow periods, buyers have a lot of the same power. So, they can really set the price on new issuance and make sure that IPOs are coming out at attractive valuations with clean governance structures, the companies kind of need to give those incentives to buyers to appeal to them. So hopefully, that when we come, these come public, the returns are good. And that, you know, increases interest in the market from both issuers and investors.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd I think we did start to see a little bit of that in the last few months, for example, Mobileye, the Intel spinoff, came public late last year, traded quite well up 40% or so right now. We saw a small insurance company come public last week, that's up over 20%, I believe. So I think we're starting to see some of those green shoots. And I think it will kind of gradually happened over the course of this year that we'll see more of those.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOne of the things that we saw Nick, and you opened with this was the death of the going public and the real harm, in terms of the reduction in the share prices of a lot of businesses, particularly in that tech and growth area, which did not have profitability. And we're projected to burn cash for quite a long time. Do you think there'll be appetite for those types of companies to go public this year?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI think it will depend on the company. Certainly, I think we've seen a lot of those private companies have shifted their mindset from kind of growth at all costs, which may have been in 2020, 2021. So more of a focus on how do we get to profitability, or at least, you know, break even. I think for the right story, investors will be willing to consider companies with losses, but I think it's going to need to be a kind of compelling story. And then, I think kind of bigger than that is just a question about valuation. Because companies that did private rounds, you know, in the last several years, often did those at very high valuations. And so if they're trying to come public today, that valuation might not be available in the market anymore. And so they have to kind of decide, do they want to wait and hope that they can, you know, grow some more and that the market will improve? Or do they want to bite the bullet and just recognize that, you know, there's no sense in waiting forever, and that if you can come public at a multibillion dollar valuation, it's still, you know, there's still a benefit to that, even if it's not quite what you're looking for.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd so I think we have seen some of the private companies have taken those steps to reset expectations, for example, Instacart lowered its internal valuation several times last year, I think, from around 40 billion to in the 10 billion range. So they're clearly looking at, you know, the reality on the ground and saying, if we're going to if we're going to come public, that's going to be the valuation we're going to be able to get in this market.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eInstacart is one specific example. Nick, thanks for taking us there. Because I'd love to just go through with you a couple of other specific companies that might go public this year. Some that are rumored to be planning IPOs are also Stripe, Discord, Reddit, TikTok coming out of Bytedance, the parent company, Epic Games. Of these maybe others, are there any that you think are potentially more likely to IPO a better position to do so than others?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, that's always hard to say with specific companies. I do think that some of these have been rumored IPOs for a while now. And part of my feeling is that if they didn't want to come public in 2021, when the market was super hot, you know, I'm not convinced they're gonna want to come this year. But I think some of these might be certainly IPO candidates. I'm sure they're watching the markets and eyeing the environment. But there are a lot of names that we track and I think some of them, like Instacart, like I mentioned, is one that we think is decently likely to come this year.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThere's some specific areas like there's a few big semiconductor companies that have been talking about IPOs and that's been an interesting area for investors in recent years. Cybersecurity is an area that I think has gotten a lot of attention lately. And there are some candidates in there like Arctic Wolf Networks, Lacework, Net Scope. So those are some names that I think, you know, could be coming. We have had a few big filings in recent months, for example, Kenvue which is a Johnson \u0026amp; Johnson spin off of consumer products.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOverall, there's just a lot of companies that are going to be monitoring the situation, and as things hopefully improve, I think some of them will, will kind of move forward with plans that they've been shelving for, you know, a year now or so.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLet's talk a bit more specifically, Nick, about what Renaissance Capital is focusing on. It’s the only ETF that's focused on tracking newly public companies. Could just define for us what newly Public means within what timeframe recently?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eEssentially, it's designed to provide investors with exposure to a portfolio of the largest and most liquid, newly listed IPOs. And so we're looking at a time frame of three years, basically, from when a company enters the index to leaves it. I mean, kind of view that as you know, that's an area of stage of life, where companies might not be included in major indices yet. So really, if you want to get exposure to that side of the market, our ETF is a way to do that. And basically, we take the IPO market, we try to cut off at about 100 million deal size, and then only talk at the top 80% and serve the market. And so the rationale is to provide exposure to the most liquid names within the IPO space. So we're, as opposed to maybe some of the small issuers that are a little low liquidity. And yeah, so and again, so that's for U.S. listed IPOs, including foreign companies that may list in the U.S.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe way we think about it is, you know, most investors are going to own, you know, funds that give them exposure to the broad equity markets, maybe it's, you know, the S\u0026amp;P 500 or other indices. But the challenge with those is that those tend to hold very mature companies, especially the S\u0026amp;P or the Dow, obviously, but other ETFs as well will hold, tend to add companies several years after they list and in some cases, you know, many years.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd so, when we look at the IPO market, we think that's not really being captured in traditional investment products, investment funds, just because those companies are usually not added to major indices early. So we look at that IPO ETF as a way to kind of complement an existing portfolio of other stocks to really get exposure to the whole IPO or to the sorry, to the whole equity markets, you need to have some exposure to IPOs. And certainly investors can do their homework and can look at individual offerings, and kind of assess the risks and rewards of those. And, you know, we certainly encourage that with some of our other products like our IPO Pro, which is a product designed to trap the IPO market for active investors. But for those who kind of don't want to be doing that work, frankly, the IPO ETF is kind of just a way to get exposure to the broader IPO market\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd the index based approach, Nick, just walk us through the benefit of that. It’s a little bit taking the work out of it to your point, but what else should we be thinking about when we're looking at ETFs and the benefits of having an index based system?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eExactly. It's designed to be, you know, entirely rules-based. So it's very transparent. And again, you can look at our website and the documentation there. At our firm a lot of our business is looking, you know, doing active fundamental research on IPOs for our institutional clients. And so there's certainly, you know, we certainly value the benefit of doing research on individual IPOs. But for a broad portfolio, we think that that kind of rules based approach, we're really capturing the whole IPO market in a way that we think makes sense and we're waiting based on floats or kind of capturing the liquidity of the market, we think that makes sense for investors who just want exposure to the broad IPO market.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNick Einhorn, VP of Research at Renaissance Capital. I want to thank you so much for joining and for offering us here at the Public community your time today.

","transcript":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eHello, everybody. Welcome to Public Live, where we explore the latest trends in business and innovation. I'm your host Ann Barry and thrilled to join you right now. Today's guest is Kayvon Mohajer, Co-founder and CEO of SoundHound, which you guys can find under the ticker S-O-U-N. SoundHound is a voice artificial intelligence platform that helps smart devices, TVs, cars, and restaurants deliver conversational AI experiences to their customers. Kayvon it is such a pleasure to welcome you to Public Live. Thanks for joining.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eThank you for having me!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, well, let's tee this up by talking about the fact that the concept of artificial intelligence, or AI, is something that has been getting a lot of attention, particularly recently with the breakout success of open AI, chat GPT, which is something we've talked about a lot here on Public Life. We can touch on that later in the discussion if you'd like. But before we dig into artificial intelligence in general, would you mind just giving listeners a little bit of background on Soundhound and what the business does?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eSo I started three companies in undergrad and but after I graduated, I decided that I wanted to be a technical founder of a super high-tech company that would make a big impact in the world. So I went to Stanford University, and I got my Ph.D. in electrical engineering. And as I was looking for that, what would that next big change would be? I turned to science fiction, and in particular, Star Trek; I said, what do they have in stock? We don't have obvious answers like spaceships that go faster than light and teleportation and holodecks and replicators. But the one that was less obvious was voice AI. So the ability to talk to computers and robots and devices and rooms and have a natural conversation with them and ask them to do things and ask them to answer questions. And I thought that's something that would happen, for sure. And in my lifetime, and without conclusion, I started working from a dorm room at Stanford with my co-founders.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry:\u003c/strong\u003e Because science fiction does tend to become science fact over time. Right. That's, that's the old adage. So fast forward to today. Kayvon, you're out of your Stanford dorm. Talk to us about how the market for voice AI has evolved and what exactly SoundHound is doing. What does the product actually deliver?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eWe spent the first 10 years in stealth, so we kept to the secret. And we wanted to own the technology and make it better than anything else that was out there, and it took 10 years. But we finally achieved that milestone, and we unveiled it a few years ago. And today, we are one of the few companies that completely owns the full stack of voice AI and conversational AI in-house. So there are a lot of players. But most of those use a platform like ours. And we are one of the very few technology providers. And one of the unique attributes of SoundHound is that we aim really high. And we solve super complex problems that push the boundaries of what is possible. For example, what others are trying to do is they want to make computers catch up to humans in language understanding. But our goal is to make computers better than humans so they can do things that humans cannot do. And we are able to support really complex conversations. And that can make people more productive and make the world a better place. And I'll give you an example. Let's say you are looking for a restaurant and you had Chinese food yesterday. So you don't want Chinese food today. You still don't ask a personal assistant to show me restaurants except for Chinese because you don't think they will work. You kind of have learned the boundaries of where they fail and you just operate in that boundary. You ask them simple questions based on keywords. And if you do ask them to show me restaurants except for Chinese, they all say here are some Chinese restaurants where they actually give you the opposite of what you want. But without technology, you can say here's an example actually works. Today Show me Asian restaurants in San Francisco, excluding Chinese and Japanese, and only show the ones that have more than three stars and are open after 9 pm On Wednesday, and you get exactly what you want. Then you can follow up and refine it, and you have a conversation in a complex conversation. So most of our customers choose us because of our superior tech. But they also choose us because you're an independent provider of voice AI. So we don't hijack their brand, product, user, and data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eSo Keyvan, give us a really specific example of that, to bring this to life for the community. So you just gave the example where voice AI was effectively being used for search, right, that you are articulating, I want to find a restaurant with this cuisine in this area. In that example, who is your client? Is it the search engine is that the restaurant and into what device or into what platform is the user speaking to get that search result?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eSo we power devices and services. So with our cars, TVs, IoT devices, appliances, and those are the endpoints to interact with, you know, these domains. And then we also power services. So, for example, for restaurants. When was the last time you call the restaurant to place an order and you had a good experience, they usually don't pick up the phone. And when they pick up the phone, they are very distracted; it's noise in the background, and they are serving people walking in. And our solution addresses that problem. We take over their phone line; we always pick up the phone so you don't miss restaurants don't miss on any calls. And we give a really good experience for every user. We take their orders, we answer their questions, upsell people and give them recommendations. So we power products and services. And we have this ecosystem vision where we bring them together. So the services that we've voice-enabled now can be accessed by the users of products like you're driving your car, you can order food, you can book appointments, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berr: \u003c/strong\u003eGot it. I mentioned at the beginning that you do service smart devices; you've repeated them: TVs, autos, and restaurants came on to give us a sense of how big your addressable market is, how far you've penetrated it, and how much room there is left to run.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eThe voice AI category in the stock market is estimated to become 160 billion. And if you include search and monetization, you know that search is today keyword based. And Google makes a lot of money for keyword-based because people search with keywords advertisers bid on those keywords. If you include the concept that the next generation of searches conversational AI and comes from advertising, it will be much bigger than that. And there are very few providers because of the high barrier to entry. And today, we powered millions of products. The power of Vizio TVs, for example, they're the second-largest TV maker in the US. Just in the last few years, we have 17 car brands have chosen SoundHound, which is very impressive. And beyond TV and automotive, the power products like Snapchat, and Pandora, we work for companies like Netflix and MasterCard to become a robust IoT (Internet of Things) devices. We announced a strategic partnership with Qualcomm to integrate voice AI into their Snapdragon chipsets and the new Italian service fee analysis that sounds for restaurants that I just talked about.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eGreat overview. It's incredible to hear just how far SoundHoud has come from that 10 years and stealth to now having a public company out there and in full visibility. Let's talk a little bit more about AI trends more broadly came on and specifically within Voice AI. Can you talk a little bit more about AI trends more broadly came on and specifically within voice? Can you talk about whether you've seen the market for voice AI tech become a bit more crowded and how SoundHound has kept its edge and a competitive advantage?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eSo I usually, so there are a lot of players in voice because Voice AI is happening, and people are adopting it, and there's a big demand for it. But there's a high barrier to entry. So the core technology providers in voice AI, I will say, a handful at a global scale. I usually say it takes 10 years to create voice AI technologies. And it takes three years to realize it will take 10 years, so I've seen several companies with resources start on the pack and then abandon it. So there's a really high barrier to entry, and as a platinum provider in multiple languages in multiple regions, multiple industries. Soundhound is very unique. So we support about 25 languages. We support multiple industries. We are in Asia; we are in Europe, we are in North America and South America, and we claim to be the best tech. And again a lot of customers are to choose us mainly for the quality of the tech. And the fact that you're independent and we don't hijack their brand and users.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eCould you talk a little bit cable and about how voice AI benefits consumers now and maybe in the future, and just what are some of the more surprising applications that, you know, the average person doesn't really know about yet? What are the hidden nuggets of the use cases that you've seen in your experience?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eI would answer that question by explaining our three-pillar business strategy because it's very innovative. You know, we've been innovating in the tech, but we also try to be innovative in the business. And the three-pillar business strategy is the answer to that. So let me explain what that is. So in the first pillar, we power devices and products like cars, TVs, and IoT devices. There will be 75 billion IoT devices projected by 2025. So the order of magnitude is larger than smartphones. And most of these devices don't have either the physical room or economical room to add, like a touchscreen or keyboard, or mouse. But the microphone is small and inexpensive. And that's all it takes to add voice to these products. So 75 billion devices, from cars, TVs, IoT devices, and appliances, can be voice-enabled. That's our pillar one. And the business model before that is very proven, you know, we get a royalty. And then we have edge and cloud. In the second pillar, we power services, like food ordering for restaurants and customer service, and think of restaurants as what books spread on Amazon. So Amazon started by selling books. They only did that a lot of people knew Amazon as an online bookstore. And when they did that really well, they did more things. And now they sell everything from A to Z. So for restaurants, there's a very complex problem. We have a lot of focus on that now. And then we'll expand to other areas. So that would be pillar two. So pillar one, and pillar two, are very, very proven business models; they don't depend on each other success of one doesn't depend on the success of the other one. And the third pillar is when we bring them together. So we bring the services that the voice-enabled to the products that be voice-enabled. And that creates a commerce ecosystem. So while you're driving your car, you can talk to your car to control the air conditioning and the radio and navigation, then you can also order food, conveniently and from restaurants that we are both enabled. And this ecosystem benefits everyone. Users, who are the most important part of the equation, are delighted because of the convenience and speed of ordering. Restaurants are happy because they get new leads from the ecosystem. And there's a lead revenue that they share with us. And then, we share that revenue with the product leaders with that car maker with the TV maker. And they benefit as well because, in many cases, they are able to generate incremental recurring revenue for the first time from the product.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eFascinating; it's been such an interesting part of the debate around AI lately, lots of conversation, talking about how the users of these new technologies are going to have to think perhaps much differently about privacy, or bias, or other ethical topics. When it comes specifically to voice AI and everything that you've seen. What are maybe some of the challenges through that ethical or privacy-focused lens that your space faces?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eOh, yeah, so those are big challenges. And they're distinct challenges to privacy is one and bias another one. So we've seen, you know, videos and write the news when you know AI does says the wrong thing or unacceptable things undesired outcome, those happen, and the privacy's and other things like devices are always listening. So on the privacy side, that's one of the advantages that we deliver to our customers: we let them define their privacy policy and let them be as transparent as they want. And as restrictive as they want. In the way, they integrate both AI. And that's one of the disadvantages that, for example, if they get it from the big tech, they just inherit their privacy policy; whatever it is, they can't really control it. So we give flexibility to our customers. And one of the areas that can address privacy concerns is the recognition of the edge. So there's the cloud, and there's the edge so, so you're increasingly seeing both demand from our customers and our ability to run everything on the edge. So, for example, that user's voice doesn't need to leave the device, and then you can have devices that always listen without sharing your audio with third parties. On the bias. That's another challenge. And we are committed to being a pioneer in addressing those challenges. Our approach is that we combine machine learning models and software engineering algorithms to create our solutions. And the software sets the boundaries for the machine learning models. And then machine learning models are companions that make our solutions better within those boundaries that are set by our software engineers. So most of these undesired outcomes, and these are scenarios that you see in the news and other demos, are when machine learning models don't have boundaries, and then they learn from bad data, and then they have unpredictable behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eTo wrap everything together, Keyvan, what are some of the priorities that you and your team have in 2023 and beyond were the big growth opportunities that you guys are looking to lean into?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eSo the world has changed. And we are adapting and transforming to the change changes. We are transforming to be a much more financially efficient organization by reducing our costs while still growing our revenue at a very healthy rate. And our goal is to become profitable and cashflow positive within this year. We announced at the end of Q3 of the year, in quiet periods after only us will be publicly disclosed last time end of Q3 we had over $300 million of booking backlog. These are from committed customers. So we have a really solid foundation for our revenue growth with our reduced costs and increased focus. We believe we will increase our revenue growth this year, and we'll achieve our goal of becoming cash flow positive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eThese are big goals, and wishing you all the very best of luck as you pursue those. Just thank you again, Keyvan Mohajer. For everything you shared with us, and your insights, it has been a long journey and really ahead of the explosion in interest.

","transcript":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eHello everybody and welcome to Public Live. I'm your host Ann Berry and looking back, it has been a bit of a bumpy and unpredictable year in the markets. But some pockets did see momentum, one of them being electric vehicles, which stand to benefit potentially from the Inflation Reduction Act that was passed earlier this year. So that's what we're going to focus on today, electric vehicles or EVs, their latest developments, and what's on the horizon as we head into 2023. Here to discuss all of this is Jay Jacobs, US head of Thematics and Active Equity ETFs at iShares. Jay, welcome back to Public Life.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd thanks so much for having me. It is great to be back on Public Live for one more time in 2022.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eI cannot believe 2022 is nearly over. I feel like the EV sector share, when you look at their share prices, are probably pretty glad that we're going into a new year, a new chapter, and putting this one behind us definitely had a busy couple of years, we have seen looking back at this year an increased interest from consumers, two major ride-hailing companies all promising to adopt electric vehicles into their fleets and the industry has been one that just can't seem to slow down. So I'd love to kick off today's show with you by walking through some of the highlights that you've tracked from the last year in the sector.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, I would say there are a few things. You know, first off, this was really kind of the year where EVs became less of a niche product and more of a mainstream product. We see that in adoption numbers. So if you look at the first half of 2022, EVS made up 26% of car sales in China, about 20% of passenger car sales in Europe, and the US actually lagging behind by only about 6%. But that is still very big numbers in a very large market around the world, showing that EVs are really coming onto the scene in a meaningful way. You add, on top of that, that we've had several car models come out this year. So basically, every major car brand has an EV now, and you see, it's not just sports cars, SUVs, it's vans, it's lower price sedans, really a model for every kind of buyer and price point out there. And then finally, yeah, we have the Inflation Reduction Act, which is one of the largest commitments ever to support the adoption of electric vehicles and clean energy, about $370 billion from the US government over the next 10 years or so, which is going to provide things like subsidies for building EV subsidies for buying EVs to really accelerate the growth of this segment. So it was, yes, 2020 was a difficult year for almost any investor in any segment of the market. EVs not being the exception. But there were a lot of things to still get excited about in the Eevee space and 2022.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eJay, let's break down a little bit more the legislation and hone in on the role of the Inflation Reduction Act. You hit the headlines for $370 billion over how long is that investment going to be made?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so it's roughly over about 10 years. This doesn't all get spent at once. And that's kind of the design, right, is that what the IRA is trying to do is accelerate the adoption of a technology that otherwise is seeing good adoption, but the US government wants to do it faster. And there are really two different ways to do that. One is increased demand. And the easiest way to increase demand is to make something cheaper. So the way that they're doing that is a $7,500 tax credit for new EVs, a $4,000 tax credit for used EVs, spurring demand by making them more affordable. The other way to do that is to increase supply. And that's actually incredibly important in the market that we're in today. Because there are actually not enough EVs to buy right now. If you try to buy a Ford F150 Lightning, you can't do it. If you want to buy, you know, some of the top models, you know, model three long ranges and make Mustangs, there are long waits, if you can even get on a waitlist right now. So the idea is, how do we spur more supply by using things like incentive tax credits and production tax credits to get these companies to build more manufacturing plants in the United States as well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eInteresting that you break down the demand and supply aspects of it so succinctly, Jay. When you think about which of those pieces are going to have the nearest term momentum, tax credits for purchasing EVs, when are they going to kick in, and then subsidies for buying more EV plants? When are they going to start getting kicked in?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eWhen the tax credits get hit as early as next year? The tax credits for building manufacturing plants could also start to come into play next year. But you know, we have to realize building a manufacturing plant is a two to three-year, four-year process even so we're not really going to see the commercial benefits of that for some time.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eLet's let's look a little bit more at trends for 2023, specifically Jay, which industries are looking to add EVs to their fleets? The famous one, of course, was Amazon, which had an agreement with Rivian to try and bring EVs into their delivery fleets. What are the other examples that you can walk us through of different industries moving into electric vehicle adoption?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eI think two are really exciting right now. So one is when we look at semi trucks, so the 18-wheelers you see on the highway, very expensive vehicles that use a lot of gas. We're starting to see progress in the electrification of that fleet. And astute listeners may have noticed the Tesla semi has been tested on the roads recently, with companies like PepsiCo putting in orders for dozens of Tesla semis going forward. So that's a really exciting development in switching the fleet from gas to electric. And then secondly, this just came out yesterday; the US Postal Service, which is the biggest operator of vehicles in the federal government in the United States, is going to put in place about 66,000 electric vehicles over the next decade or so. So this is massive, this is going from, you know, just electric vehicles being kind of a niche sports car, to really being the predominant form of passenger vehicles or light-duty vehicles or even heavy-duty vehicles and the Tesla semi example going forward. So these are exciting times.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eThis is x 1000s. Quite the number doing know, Jay, which manufacturers and which brands are going to be procured from.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, they're there from a couple of brands. One is Oshkosh, which is more of a military supply company, but builds a lot of postal service car tracks, and the others are going to come from the private sector, more from major car brands even announced which ones yet. Here's the fun fact, though, the little postal service truck that people have seen on the roads for decades only gets about eight miles per gallon. So you can see pretty quickly how switching to an electric really ramps up the efficiency of the postal service not just to reduce emissions, but to reduce operating costs; no longer paying so much for gas can actually really lower costs for shipping.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eLet's talk a little bit about EV stocks, Jay, because for people interested in electric vehicles and looking to play in the market, I'm curious if you'd be able to share some of the high-level signals or metrics that you and your team look for when evaluating EV players?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eSure. So really, the primary thing that we look at is revenue from the EV ecosystem. Now the art in that is really what is the EV ecosystem. It's very obvious to say that EV manufacturers, like some of the hubs that we've mentioned already, are very key to the electric manufacturers like some of the hubs that we've mentioned already are very key to the electric vehicle theme. But it actually goes far beyond that. And so you can think about, you know, who are the companies that actually build the batteries that go into electric vehicles, they're obviously part of the ecosystem, who's doing the lithium mining and processing that goes into those batteries, who's building the electronics and the parts that are supplied into electric vehicles. And there are really dozens of companies beyond some of the headline names that are really participating in the ecosystem. We often call this thematic beta or thematic risk, the risk here being these companies are tied to the potential adoption of electric vehicles. If the adoption for electric vehicles happens the way that we expect it to, these companies will be rewarded for that risk. If electric vehicles get supplanted by new technology, or for some reason, don't make it, they don't get escape velocity, and the internal combustion engine lives on, then companies with this thematic risk would be punished. But what we are really looking at is what are the companies that have that highest thematic risk to the electric vehicle ecosystem. And we really measure that by who gets the most revenue from electric vehicles and the entire ecosystem.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd how about in the US versus internationally? I mean, the Inflation Reduction Act here in the US has caused enormous momentum domestically. Are there players you look at or parts of the supply chain that you look at internationally and that are publicly traded?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eOh, absolutely. Yeah. I mean, this is a theme that is not confined to borders. Yes, we saw, you know, the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States. You know, we've seen other efforts in China and Europe to spur greater electric vehicle adoption as well. So it's really a global theme, and we see global companies participating in it. There are a lot of battery manufacturers coming from South Korea and beyond. There are a lot of lithium miners in Australia. There are parts suppliers all around the world as well. So when we think about this theme, we are absolutely looking at it through global hubs.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eCan we talk a little bit about how EV ETFs work Jay, as an investor, thinking about adding EV exposure to their portfolio\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, absolutely. So EV ETFs are really trying to get exposure to that EV ecosystem by investing in companies around the world. So, for example, our IDRV ETF and iShares invest in lithium mining companies, refiners, battery producers, and car manufacturers in the electric vehicle space, as well as part suppliers, and really provides exposure to that entire ecosystem in one ETF. This has many benefits for investors, but one of them being it's hard to identify these companies on your own because they're not just US large-cap brand names. It can be smaller international companies. It's just hard for individual investors to access this ecosystem at the individual stock level. Secondly, there's just a lot of efficiency and doing this through an ETF rather than going out and buying 50 companies around the world on your own. You can put in an order for one ETF like IDRV and get exposure to that entire basket with one trade. So, you know, when we design an ETF like IDRV, we're really focused on capturing the pure-play companies across the entire ecosystem of a theme, in this case, electric vehicles, to get that exposure to investors.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd then, Jay, could you give us a little bit of color on a couple of things that help with the myth-busting? Because EVs have tended to seem like the cars of the future. They're sort of here with us now. But what are some of the assumptions that people may still have about electric vehicles that maybe just aren't true?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eI think one of the biggest misconceptions is that they're still expensive. Yes, there are EVs at very high price points. But there's actually several models that are coming in below the average purchase price of a new vehicle in the United States, which is about $50,000 these days. On top of that, you have tax credits, which can make them even cheaper. And then, on top of that, you have lower maintenance. So electric vehicles don't need an oil change each year. Actually, through regenerative braking, it's less frequent that you need to do brake pads and brake rotor replacement. No spark plugs to replace every 50,000 miles. So it is already cheaper in many instances to own an electric vehicle than an internal combustion engine when you look at the entire lifetime ownership. So you ought you add all that together. And the economic argument for electric vehicles is really starting to come into the forefront here, which we believe is only going to accelerate adoption. It's not just about is this a better car? Do I like the car? Do I like how it looks? If it is cheaper off the land or cheaper over the lifetime ownership experience? We think that's really going to bring the mass markets into the Evie space.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eWhat about Jay, one thing that just come up? Recently, I looked at a company that was trying to find ways to make it easier for Evie owners to be able to charge their vehicles. How about that element? Is the infrastructure going to be there to support getting more electric vehicles on the roads?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eIt's certainly growing. And we've been talking a lot about the Inflation Reduction Act. But another piece of policy in the United States is really accelerating electric charging, which was the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act passed last November. The idea behind that act is to put about seven and a half billion dollars into building 500,000 chargers around the country. So a lot more densification of electric charging. This, in many ways, is basically a subsidy for EV buyers because if there are more chargers and there are faster chargers, in the places that you want to see them. You don't need as big of a battery. And so, if you have a smaller battery, you don't have to pay as much for an electric vehicle. So you can see how different policies from the US government are really trying to accelerate adoption, whether it's tax credits for buyers, whether it's incentives for manufacturers, or building up a charging infrastructure.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eWith that, I want to thank you, Jay Jacobs, Head of Thematics and Active Equity ETFs at iShares. And thank you to our partners at iShares for making today's show possible. We'll be back soon with even more information on all things science, healthcare, and tech, three of my favorite topics.

Welcome to Alts, the show on Public all about alternative investing and emerging trends happening at the intersection of culture and investing. I'm your host, Calum Johnson from the Alts team. Before we get into it, let's get the energy in the room up. Let's hit that like button. We've got a really exciting episode for you guys with some great guests. So let's get into that.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday we are joined by Dylan and Bradley from Altan insights, the leading platform for alternative asset investing, intelligence and analysis. Dylan and Bradley will be sharing some of the biggest findings from their latest research on the sports collectibles market covering both sports cards and memorabilia. Since we're going to be talking about so many current events and what's happening in these markets, at the moment through the report, and there's a lot to get through, we're going to skip the five and five and jump directly into it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo without further ado, let me hand it over to the guests. Dylan, Bradley, could you quickly reintroduce yourself to the audience? I know you've come on Public live a few times. Introduce yourself and Altan insights. Give us a bit of an overview of the new report that you've just released about sports collectibles in general.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eGreat. Thanks, Calum and thanks for having us back. My name is Dylan Dittrich, and I kind of lead the research effort at Altan Insights. And what Altan really focuses on is kind of empowering and arming the modern investor to explore alternative asset classes. Specifically, we look at collectible asset classes, things like fine art, wine, sports collectibles, classic cars. And so providing research analysis and data to kind of dig deeper into those asset classes, understand how they perform and understand the different kinds of forces that drive them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so as part of that effort on a quarterly basis, we put out a report on the state of the sports collectibles market, how sports cards are performing, how sports memorabilia is performing, you know, what are the different trends in different sports? How are collectors and investors approaching these categories? So I certainly would encourage everybody to visit the site and download the report if you're interested and have the time - but it was certainly an interesting second quarter to chronicle. Much like other assets that can be more speculative in nature, sports collectibles were challenged in some pockets, but had some really kind of interesting and even encouraging things happening in others. So looking forward to kind of diving into those with you guys today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd I'll just second Dylan. Thank you for having me on. I'm with Altan Insights as well. I do research alongside Dylan. I worked on the sports collectibles report that we put out recently in the first and second quarters as well as our art report and I’m also a qualified appraiser with the International Society of appraisers covering art, collectibles and memorabilia. So I've always had a big interest in the valuations of these assets, following them as actual investable vehicles and just tracking the data and the performance records everything that you can see in our reports on a quarterly basis, and you know, just putting out the research that we do looking at the sales and kind of going beyond just the numbers, so thank you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, great. Thank you both for the introduction. I want to get straight into the report. So like, what have we learned about the sports collectibles market in Q2? And I want to take kind of one of the big points that you made in that report, which was, are we seeing a healthy reset of the market away from speculation, or has a paradigm shift occurred that will change the way these markets perform going forward?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so I think just to zoom out a little bit, like some other categories of when, when the pandemic hit, kind of fueled by nostalgia fueled by stimulus checks, fueled by more time at home, sports collectibles really started to soar. So sports cards in particular, as people kind of, you know, revisited old treasures that might have been in the basement or the attic, and kind of revisited hobbies from their past. And it just brought a huge new audience into this space. And with that new demand came, you know, very rapid appreciation in these categories. And, as was the case, in other categories that saw similarly heightened demand over the last few years, the second quarter of 2022, was was challenging, as people became kind of skittish about the state of the economy, skittish about, you know, traditional financial markets, they were relatively eager and willing to sell these assets. And in many cases, that led to, you know, significant kind of declines in value across many different categories within the sports collectible space. And so I think a part of that is, is very likely a healthy reset of perhaps some things that had run a little bit too high, too fast.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut I think it's also important to add the caveat that, you know, it seems kind of indisputable that since before the last few years, the audience has definitely grown for the long term. And so, you know, we'd still expect to see there, you know, be more interested in this space than there was previously. But you know, when there's economic economic turmoil, when there's traditional financial market turmoil, it's not uncommon to see speculative assets like these sell off, even though that hasn't necessarily always been the case in sports collectibles. You know, historically, in other moments of financial crisis, economic crisis 2008, 2009, for example, you know, there are indices that suggest that sports cards didn't sell off that much. But, you know, we live in a very different kind of market today where people can basically sell cards that at a moment's notice, you know, friction is much lower than it has been in the past. And so when kind of investor and collector sentiment turns, you know, people can act on that, and so very easily nowadays and, and I think that played a role in sending some valuations lower in q2.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eBradley, did you want to jump in?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley: \u003c/strong\u003eI second Dylan on that. And also say that while we saw those pullbacks within the broader market, and I'm sure we'll touch on the upper end of the market, it continued to hold up well, which is something we haven't seen tested over the last few years, right. These are markets that have been tracked in some cases for decades now, and to see the broader market pull back rather significantly, and in some cases, well beyond even just a traditional stock market or other asset classes, but then to also simultaneously see the highest end of the card market your your blue chip type cards and memorabilia, seeing record prices, and in some cases, the auctions seeing heightened volume, more bidders, an increase in bids on high end cards definitely showed just a shift almost, when you look at a traditional market, that movement from maybe growth to value that you see sometimes in downturns. So it's certainly some things that we see across other markets are being replicated in sports collectibles as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, awesome. And just as a point for both of you, definitely feel free to just jump in whenever you want. We want to be as much of a conversation as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think you both made some great points. Dylan, I wanted to pick up on one thing you mentioned, which is the sports card market today, there's a lot less friction when it comes to access to liquidity. Could you go a bit deeper into that like, versus what we've seen historically, what are some of the factors that have caused there to be a lot less friction in the market, it's a lot easier for people to, like exit their position. Is that auctions? Is that the fractional markets? What are some of those factors that have caused that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, I think when you think about all of this new demand that's come into the space, you know, with that comes investment dollars and the pursuit of innovation, to make things, you know, easier on that new demand to make it easier for them to transact. And so I think a lot of the leading platforms in the space, whether you're talking about auction houses, whether you're talking about marketplaces, the technology that they're using has advanced considerably. The marketing around auctions has increased considerably, the frequency of auctions has increased considerably. And there's also a lot of, you know, competition to be the venue where people are buying and selling sports collectibles, and so that has the power to lower costs as well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so, whereas, you know, in decades prior, somebody might move to sell a card, and they might have to wait, you know, a month or two for the next auction, or they had to, you know, create their own eBay listing and kind of wait for that to be completed, it's really a lot easier today and it takes a lot less kind of manual legwork. And there are many platforms, you know, kind of designed to make buying and selling these things akin to buying and selling stocks. And we see that with fractional platforms as well. And so there's definitely an increased focus on liquidity, which is great, that means you can convert your asset to cash in a shorter amount of time and with greater ease. But on the flip side of that, that means that, you know, a market and valuations and price levels can react a whole lot faster when people start getting a bit nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, I think it's such an interesting point that like the reduction in friction, means that from a psychological point of view, investors in sports cards can now act a lot more similar to how, you know, investors in more traditional assets, like stocks can behave.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and I think, you know, to use an example from a more traditional asset class, you know, you know, the performance of asset classes, like private equity and private real estate, are always touted as being quite strong on a risk adjusted basis. But part of that is because the, you know, the valuations are kind of marked to market, aren’t updated with as greater frequency as public markets. And these, you know, private investment firms aren't buying and selling with as much frequency as actors and traditional public markets. So in a way that kind of smooths over those, those rough economic and financial patches, it's not to say that their performance isn't strong, but there's there is kind of an element of the way that it's measured, you know, kind of making things look a little bit stronger on paper sometimes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, that's a really interesting point. I want to get a bit deeper into the data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd Bradley, maybe we can check to you for this one. I know one of the things that you mentioned in the report, was that you use the PWCC indices to kind of understand the market and what's happening. Can you quickly just explain to our audience, first of all, why is the PWCC indices so important for that? And then also, what are some of the limitations of using those indexes to look at the market today?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, definitely. So PWCC they’re a marketplace and auction house and they have multiple indices, they have five ranging from the PWCC, 100 500, and then 2500. And their indices track a range of cards, but they are primarily vintage based. So you mentioned, like some of the shortfalls of those indices, one of them is that they do primarily track vintage cards, so cards dating really pre 1980s. And so PWCC, they really have the longest tenure as a performance tracking metric, they date back to the early…actually to 2008 is when the PWCC indices start. So you kind of get that tail and in the 2009 timeframe of the financial crisis. So you have one of the reasons why I believe that they're used so frequently is not only because they date back, but more importantly, because they date back to a very specific moment in financial markets history. And they, if you look at the indices, they do change in terms of their composition, but they primarily revolve around your blue chip Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays, Jackie Robinson, Babe Ruth cards, whether they're rookies or just pre-war, or close to post-war cards, and those cards while they've performed very well, it's not always the greatest representation of the overall market. As I had discussed previously about how the broader market struggled but the blue chip higher end market performed very well, we just saw that happen.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo if you're looking at, you know, the last six to nine months, you might see a lot of cards across the board. And a lot of cars, maybe people on here owned, have maybe dropped in value. But meanwhile, we're seeing some record sales for Honus Wagner or Mickey Mantle or Babe Ruth, or whoever that player might be in their rookie cards or in some of their early cards, that maybe is not the greatest representation of the overall market. So that's the one challenge, it is used just because we need some way of tracking an industry that has a composition of multiple cards across a span of time. But as with any industry, it might not be the best representation of the overall market and also of the sale frequency. So it's not necessarily looking at in a downturn market, is the volume still the same? Are people still selling their cards in that period of time? Are people still buying those cards in that period of time? Is the market still as active? There's a lot of metrics that maybe aren't incorporated in some of those indices, which do create the shortfalls, but are still important to include in any research and analysis.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eI think it's such an interesting distinction, definitely when I started to learn more about sports cards, the distinction between like the vintage older cards, and then the more modern sports card, and perhaps you can both touch on this. Why do vintage markets perform so differently than like, more modern sports cards? Is it purely just about scarcity and supply? Or are there other factors that we can look at?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so this is, this was definitely one of the more interesting kind of tidbits to come out of our Q2 analysis. If you looked at second quarter performance of vintage and prewar cards, they were effectively flat down very, very slightly 1 to 2% versus modern and ultra modern cards, which were down in the neighborhood of 15 to 20%. And I think part of that is, you know, modern and ultra modern tend to be a bit more speculative in nature, you have speculation on players that are currently active younger players, people who have more of their career left in some areas, particularly in the ultra modern space.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd when you look at vintage, there's a very long tenured collector base, the scarcity is naturally very low, just just by nature of the fact that these cards have been around for decades and decades. You know, over time, some have been lost, they've been damaged, so supply is very low. And I think, you know, many collectors aren't turning these cards over with as great a frequency - they're holding on to them. And that means less supplies available to the market, which of course can help keep, you know, prices kind of higher as demand grows, or even stays the same. And that's where you find a lot of quote unquote, blue chip cards that are very, very popular historically that are very well known, that are kind of like the top pieces of almost akin to fine art in this category. So a bit less speculation, less supply, and more longer tenured collectors and holders of these assets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and then just to add, there's also been so many market shifts across you know, when these cards were initially coming out, think about some of the cards maybe you've seen breaking records like a T 206 Honus Wagner like these were really advertisements. They weren't built for card collectors. They weren't being produced in mass for you know..they were being produced and then slid into a pack of gum or candy or cigarettes, or they were being stuck at tables at diners. They weren't being produced where then we saw that shift in the 70s, 80s, 90s, where then it rotated into what is known as the junk wax era where you had producers of cards, pumping out incredibly high quantities of cards. There's a ton out on the market, you don't really see a whole lot of 1990s players with high, high sales in their cards and today, the shift has really turned to grading where we’re seeing such an increase in cards being graded. People are sending them off to places like Beckett, PSA, SGC to be graded and a very high percentage of cards within populations are being graded. So it's just been a real overall shift in the market that has definitely aided I think vintage as standing out and standing alone from a period of time where people weren't collecting cards maybe for investment pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson:\u003c/strong\u003e Bradley can you kind of go –I think that's a really interesting point you brought up on the grading, right? Can you kind of go a bit deeper? What is the impact on the market overall of you know, you're getting more PSA 10s You're getting more BGS 9.5 or whatever, like, what is the impact on vintage versus modern?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, definitely. It’s an impact that I don't think is probably being discussed enough. We do cover it quite a bit. We have a partnership with a company called Gem Rate, who tracks the percentage and the number of cards graded by companies like I mentioned previously, PSA, Beckett,STC. And for example, just PSA alone, they're seeing record cards coming through and being graded in items altogether. You know, their Q2 numbers, and this past quarter were the highest they've ever had graded. I believe the past month was their highest month on record. So at this point, you know, they've had two months this year, believe it was March, and then now July that have been their two highest grading totals in company history, in terms of just number of items.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd that impacts everything because a lot of these prices, especially in modern cards are dictated by the grade. So for example, PSA grades on a numeric scale one to 10. With as well as an authentic grade if the card is maybe in too poor of quality, to receive a number. But a PSA 10, which would be like a gem mint card, the highest tier, will historically sell for higher than a PSA nine of that same card, right? There may be a flaw in the nine that deducts that one point. The problem is that people today are pulling cards out of packs and sending them immediately to PSA, the card has a higher chance than receiving a 10. And in turn, that overall population is skyrocketing, right? We're seeing some players like in the NBA, Zion Williamson, John Moran, where they have super high numbers of - I mean talking 10s of 1000s of PSA 10 graded cards for some of their base cards right now. Where for example, with the vintage, you have to almost get to the 60s before you start seeing a lot of these cards, receiving tents and that just comes down to people weren't pulling them and sending them out\u0026nbsp;immediately from packs. So it definitely is having an impact. And I think long term, we're going to see a swell of cards that were graded, that received 10s. It's going to be very difficult to really ever find appreciation and an increase in value when you have a card that has 20,000+ grades, and then maybe 10 to 15% of that population is a PSA 10.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd if you think about it, Calum, if you're an owner of a great advantage card, the threat of the population have that card growing now and really making your card a lot less valuable just by nature of the supply growing is a lot lower relative to modern because you know these cards have been in circulation they've been unwrapped from packs decades ago, you know, every now and then yes, some some new population will find its way to the to the grading companies. But you know, the likelihood of that happening at scale is much lower than it is for modern and ultra modern cars, and that's why the kind of the risk return formula, so to speak, for vintage is a lot different than it is for modern and ultra modern cards.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, I think that's super interesting. I'm going to ask one more question on the card point before we shift over to game one memorabilia and memorabilia overall, which I know is a very different picture than the card market.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think one thing that was interesting as I was going through the report is amongst all kind of the doom and gloom in the sports card market, there were some promising signs. The economist David RPA, modern hockey card record sale at Heritage last month, the upcoming heritage auction for the Mantle. Can you both just kind of comment on those two sales and what you think they might indicate about the market overall as we look forward?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich:\u003c/strong\u003e I mean the Mantle sale - so for context, one of the very highest graded 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle cards is up for auction at Heritage auction later this month, the special card because basically what happened was, these cards weren't wildly popular. When they were released back in 1952. They sat on shelves, and it was time for basically the 1953 print run to start being sold and tops needed the warehouse space. So they basically dumped boxes, and boxes and boxes of these cards into the ocean. And Mickey Mantle is kind of one of the preeminent, you know, baseball, cultural icons, certainly baseball card icons. And so probably one of the four very best examples of this card is being auctioned later this month. It's already over $7 million at auction, there's, I think, a pretty strong expectation that it's going to end up at $10 million plus.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe last time there was a sale of..so that's an SGC 9.5 Mickey Mantle. Back in early 2021, there was a sale of a PSA nine mantle for $5.2 million. And, you know, the stats are pretty clear that afterwards, not only did the broader and kind of lower quality Mantle market absolutely soar higher, but you could make the argument that, you know, it led to, you know, significant appreciation in the broader card market as well. It's a really big deal when a sale that big makes a very wide range of mainstream news headlines, because that creates new demand. It gets people excited about the space again, and it tends to have pretty wide ranging impacts. Now granted, it does take a sale of $5 million or $10 million to generate that excitement, which is exceedingly rare, but it does happen and it'll be really interesting to see, you know, what happens in the wake of that sale next month, or later this month rather.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd all along the Mantle card has always stood out from a baseball standpoint, similar to in hockey. We've had a seven figure sale of Wayne Gretzky, but we have also been tracking as you mentioned, the McDavid card. So modern hockey has similar to some of the other modern sports has lagged pretty significantly in terms of the overall market. So in the first quarter, golden oxygens sold a Sidney Crosby card. It was a gold precious metal gems and went for 100 in just under $165,000, which set a record for any modern hockey card. And then in this past quarter or the past quarter we've just had or past month, there was a 2015 Connor McDavid card, which is an autographed patch card. So it has a patch from a game worn jersey within it, and it's sold for $228,000. So that established a new modern hockey card price.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd actually, this is very timely, because just this week, there was one of the other so there are three cards in the population for the Connor McDavid that are graded PSA 10, and another one just sold this week for just over $200,000. So heading into the second quarter, we had never had a sale for a modern hockey card go for more than $200,000 and now we've had one, you know, essentially in the past 30 days now we've had two cards, same card, same grade, but it was definitely a validating sale to see one sell via eBay for over $200,000. So definitely some momentum within that market. But again, it's really a couple names: Connor McDavid, Sidney Crosby, Alexander Ovechkin. But beyond those three, hockey though, just continues to trail the field overall for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, very interesting. I'm conscious that we're nearly at time. Everyone can stay on if they're interested to hear more, because we're gonna go into the sports memorabilia market. And I think if Q1 was kind of, you know, there was a plunging in the sports card market. I think it was the exact reverse on the sports memorabilia side.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCould you, and I'll put this to both of you. Can you kind of just give us some context, data wise what we saw with sports memorabilia, and then also like, what is the significance like why did this happen?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so on kind of the second part of that question first. So when the sports card market was was booming, you'd see, and Bradley just alluded to one of them, you would see these cards that have little patches from either a game worn or player player worn jersey, selling for, you know, hundreds of 1000s of dollars, which in many cases is more than a full game used jersey would actually sell for. And so I think for the last few years, people both outside of the space, especially but also inside the space, have kind of taken a step back and said like, that doesn't make any sense. Like why is this little patch that's, you know, encased in cardboard selling for more than an entire game use jersey. And I think, you know, the idea that that shouldn't necessarily be the case has started to take hold, and the second quarter we saw, really for the entirety of 2022, but really in the second quarter we saw game worn jersey sales make headlines, there was a Diego Maradona, game worn jersey from the famous Hand of God World Cup match sold for over $9 million. Sotheby’s Golden Age auctions sold a set of Tiger Woods clubs from when he won the tiger slam for over $5 million.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so we just saw a huge volume of sales that were kind of headline sales that were over six figures. So to put it in context, in the second quarter of 2022. There were 42 sales at auctions of game used memorabilia that crossed $100,000. A year ago in the second quarter, there were just 13. So you're talking about more than triple, you know, increase. And I think a lot of that is, you know, card collectors coming into this space and realizing that there's, you know, an opportunity to own some incredible artifacts that, you know, maybe stand out from kind of the traditional to their traditional kind of cardboard pursuits.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, we put out actually a thread today on Twitter, Altan Insights, where we covered some of these record breaking sales and sports memorabilia. And one of the big highlights is, you know, the record books have really been reconstructed this year. There's three of the five largest public sales ever that have occurred. In terms of sports memorabilia, just this year alone. Dylan mentioned the Maradonna and then also the Tiger Woods. Also the Muhammad Ali championship belt that's sold. So we're just seeing the shift of people going after these really high end really impressive items that have historic context around them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo it's really exciting to see this shift in this movement of money that's going after you look at even at the Heritage auction coming up that we mentioned, there's the Mickey Mantle card, and that's going to be the big headline grabber. But very likely we'll see a new record set for a baseball bat. There's a 1918,1920 circa Babe Ruth game used in sign that that right now is priced just under a million dollars. I wouldn't be surprised if it by the end of the auction is a multi million dollar bat. It's a really impressive piece that is one of the earliest bats on the market that we've ever seen. I know there's been a lot of collectors out there looking for Babe Ruth's first bat that he used. So that had hit the market back in the early 2000s and went for over a million dollars. It hasn't came back yet. But this bat is probably about the second best thing that we've ever seen.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd the momentum is just continuing within the space. And also just announced yesterday, I believe Sotheby's is going to be selling a Michael Jordan jersey from the 1998 NBA Finals. And that jersey will likely establish not only a new record for any Michael Jordan, game use jersey, but actually any basketball jerseys. We would need to get up to about 4 million to do that. It has an estimate between 3 to 5 million, but with the momentum we're seeing in the prices for other athletes like Ali marathon Tiger Woods, probably seems fitting that Michael Jordan would fit in somewhere in that as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eNow that's pretty iconic. You know, one thing I wanted to follow up on when we talk about these really high sale prices, especially with sports memorabilia. I know one thing that comes into it is the photo matching element. Could you guys just speak briefly about - refresh the audience on what is photo matching, first of all? And then why has it become so important in the valuation of these assets?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, photo matching has become a critically important topic. I think it always, not always, but it has been important over the last few years, but its importance has only increased as you see these very high value auction items being sold, and therefore the stakes being raised. And essentially, for those that don't know, you know, if you talk about something like a Michael Jordan worn jersey, or you know, a Wayne Gretzky worn jersey from the Stanley Cup, you want to know, if you're paying millions of dollars for this item? How do I know that he wore it in this game.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so what photo matching is to kind of simplify it is basically comparing the game worn Jersey in question to very high resolution photos taken during the game in question, to match up very kind of, in most cases, minute details to confirm that this is indeed the jersey that was worn by that player in that game. And it can be things as small as you know, different holes in the mesh different, you know, little pieces of stitching, and how they appear on the jersey and, and matching those elements to the Jersey that's being sold.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd you know, I think when these very large prices are being paid, authentication is so very critical for the credibility of the market, for the credibility of those selling the item. And then for the buying collector to you know, be reassured that the item they've spent money on was who was really as built. And so photo matching is one way that that's accomplished. And you're kind of hard pressed to see nowadays, items sell for very high values without being photo matched to, you know, a certain moment. Generally not the case for more vintage items, for obvious reasons that the high resolution photography that you need to really make a conclusive photo match wasn't available until really, really more recently, but definitely important for any kind of more modern piece of game worn material.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd to follow up, we dove into some of the data behind that photo matching and just looking at so in Q2, out of the top 10 sales, eight of them were marketed as being photo matched. And so there's a few companies out there Resolution, My Gray, who photo match these items, and 18 of the top point five items sold memorabilia wise at auction in the second quarter, add some label or some nod to photo matching, and that compares to 60% of the top 10, the previous year, 12 out of the top 25. So a pretty big difference. It's been around as Dylan had mentioned, but at this point, especially as we start to see these modern assets and the memorabilia side, continue to develop in price, it's pretty much necessary outside of a certificate or a letter of authenticity from the league, or the player itself. You know, memorabilia has always been a little bit of a money market because a lot of these assets weren't supposed to ever make it to an auction house, right?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, the Tiger Woods clubs that Golden Age sold, there was a little dispute because Tiger Woods and his agent claimed to still have the clubs, because there's almost this idea that they're not supposed to ever leave the player and it's somebody's responsibility to grab that jersey after the game and keep it, or to secure the club so they never see an auction house. But it was the work of some experts in the space that looked at a bunch of attributes around the clubs between the grip to ball marks to photos, and then were able to provide an opinion a photo match that pretty clearly had an impact considering they sold for over $5 million and easily exceeded any previous golf clubs sold by about $5 million. So it's having an impact on these markets, no question about it. And I really think in the next few years, it's going to become...if it's anything that is photo-matchable so it's not vintage, but it's anything really 1970 on it's going to require some sort of photo matching being a given for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eIt's really interesting, and to be honest, it's pretty incredible that some of these assets they can even match it using photographs and all these things. Before we close out, I wanted to talk about the Muhammad Ali belt. Huge sale, there $6.18 million. I think the initial estimate was to be around like a million dollars.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan you talk about what was the level of photo matching that we saw there? What was some of the story behind that? Like, why did it exceed the estimate by such a large degree?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eSo this is actually one of those interesting and rare cases where there actually wasn't a photo match at hand. And really, what the kind of source of you know, credibility and authenticity here was the provenance so meaning what was kind of the line of ownership from, you know, when the belt was on Muhammad Ali to when it came to auction. So a little bit of background, I think it was last month, heritage sold the WBC Heavyweight Championship belt that Muhammad Ali earned for his win in the Rumble in the Jungle, and they sold it for just under $6.2 million.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis one came from the collection of Drew Bandini Brown, who was Ali's corner man. He kept a lot of artifacts, memorabilia from all of his career in a storage unit. Eventually, the contents of that storage unit were sold. But it's a case where you know you have pretty strong provenance. You know where that belt’s been, you feel fairly confident that this is a belt that was earned by Ali - it was worn by Ali.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd it really led to a bidding war between two bidders who were seemingly unwilling to lose. Turns out the winner was Colts owner Jim Irsay, who has basically been building a museum quality collection of kind of American cultural artifacts that he's actually taken on tour. So it's like, it's one of my favorite kind of investing rules for you know, really blue chip alternative collectibles is like, would Jim Irsay buy this because time and time again, he invariably shows up as a winner of a lot of these auctions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut yeah, one of those rare cases where, you know, photo matching wasn't playing a significant role in the authenticity here. But sometimes at an auction, all it takes is two highly motivated bidders to drive a value to, you know, levels that people previously thought were unheard of. Especially interesting in this case, because there is another WBC Heavyweight Championship belt that actually trades fractionally. And, you know, now that the question becomes, you know, what's that one worth? So definitely an interesting, very interesting piece of memorabilia. Very interesting story, and, you know, another just massive result.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eJust as a follow up, I actually spoke this week with a representative from Heritage who runs some of their consignment, and was talking to him at one point about that night when it's sold, and it was out of the blue for them. So we talked about where something like that comes from, he had actually gone to sleep, said he woke up at like 3am and stuff was like still going. And to see, you know, they, you know, some people that are going to be involved in the auction, for example, they set a million dollar estimate, they had word of mouth from some potential betters that those bidders weren't going to let it go for under a million. But that's all it takes is two bidders on some of these items.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd the same could go for this Mantle card coming up at the end of the month, or the Jordan jersey in September that I mentioned previously, like, it just comes down to if you have some people who are willing to put out that kind of money. And now we're at a point where that table and that tier has been set, where now it used to be a million dollars was a big hurdle for an auction house to clear. If they could clear that million dollar, you know, everyone was clapping and it was a really respectable auction. And that meant that they had a really strong line of bidders where it's almost 5 million at this point where, you know, it's like you're expected to have bidders lined up that are willing to push these items higher and higher the levels that we just haven't seen up until this year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, it's pretty incredible to be honest, when you look at some of the other asset markets for crypto, for stocks, and you see how bearish people are and kind of the the sentiment there that we still have some of these really high ticket sales and records being broken in some of the alternative asset markets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDylan and Bradley, It's been a pleasure to have you guys on the show again, you're always welcome.

Welcome to Alts, the show on Public all about alternative investing and emerging trends happening at the intersection of culture trend investing. I'm your host Calum Johnson from the Alts team. Today, we are joined by Gerard Starkey, sports memorabilia expert, and co-founder of SAAS. Over the last 20 years, Gerard has built one of the most valuable and complete Michael Jordan player exclusive game worn collections in the world, and has been featured in Highsnobiety and elsewhere, as one of the preeminent MJ collectors. Sports memorabilia is a really exciting alts category, and he'll be demystifying it for us today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore we get to that, though, we're going to cover some of the biggest headlines happening in the world of alts in a section I like to call five and five, five headlines in five minutes. Let's get started. So first of all, Nike sold a virtual NFT sneaker designed by artists to Kashi American army for $134,000. The sneaker was one of 20,000 in Nike;s first release with artifact in April. Collectors are hoping the shoes will become part of games like fortnight and Grand Theft Auto Six, while others are interested in physical versions of the shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eeBay is launching its first ever NFT collection. Thirteen limited edition NFTs that feature 3D animations of hockey legend Wayne Gretzky making one of his signature moves. They plan to drop additional NFT collections throughout the year in partnership with web3 platform OneOf.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe world's largest bottle of whiskey was sold for $1.4 million by auction house, Lyon and Turnbull on May 25. The bottle stands at an incredible 5’11 and was given a Guinness world record for being the world's largest bottle of whiskey in September 2021. It contains enough to fill about 444 standard bottles, or enough to make 5,287 whiskey sours, which is pretty crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNew York based real estate, investment and brokerage firm Acada listed a New York building as an NFT on OpenSea for 15,000 ETH, approximately $27 million. The NFT represents ownership of the building. However, the buyer still has to follow standard real estate procedure offline for the transaction to go through.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, a former OpenSea employee has been indicted in the first ever case of NFT insider trading. Thirty-one year old former Product Manager Nathaniel Chastain was responsible for selecting which NFTS would be displayed on OpenSea’s homepage. He would then use that information to buy those NFTs before they were featured, and then flip them for 2-5x profits after that. So that's our five and five for today. We're now going to switch over to speaking with our guest Gerard Starkey. Gerard, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to have you on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eThanks for having me on. It's a pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, awesome. I'm super excited for this one. So just to begin, can you give us a backstory? I think you have like the most valuable MJ game on collection out there. Can you kind of just give us an intro into how you got into collecting these items?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eI think first just to correct slightly, at one point in time, I was definitely the most valuable Michael Jordan collector, but in the recent in recent years, some very, very large investors have come in and bought up, you know, millions of millions of dollars of items in a very short span of time. So I'm definitely up there in the top two or three guys, but I'm possibly not the most valuable at this stage. But I was at one point.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, you're in the conversation for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I'm definitely up there. But I don't want to claim the crown without giving my peers and fellow collectors, you know, the same type of esteem all the way up at the top there. For me it started before value was even a concern because for me it started out of pure passion as a teenager. And as you said earlier on, I've been collecting for about 25+ years. And I didn't necessarily start in Michael Jordan stuff. Specifically like stuff he'd actually used. It actually started just in the kind of the regular kind of original Jordans that were available at the time and and gradually progressed through the various kind of categories of collecting whether it was like originals, hard to get rare samples, back to originals again, and then the original market.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOriginal releases of the Jordan shoes where it was very hot in late 90s, early 2000s, like it was, it just increased massively. And I actually was given a pair of game-worn Jordans from an ESPN athlete, I can go into that story at some point, but I was given them by an ESPN, so a cameraman, who was French. And when, as soon as I held that asset, the asset that I previously owned at the time, but that I previously collected didn't mean as much to me, because I had this asset that, you know, represented this athlete. And at that point, I took the opportunity to sell all my originals, which I sold very quickly. And I basically plugged it all into actual game news items. And now that was not as easy to find, but I'm quite resourceful. I speak seven or eight languages.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I basically went into the market on a global scale and just bought everything I could. And this went on for about 1015 years before the real boom happened, and I did it quite silently, because that was just my strategy, not quite being quite a competitive person. And being well, I was based in London, most of that time. So all of my peers were in Asia and the States. So for me to get stuff, I have to really hustle and bustle and just just grab as much as I could. And yeah, to this day, I don't sell my own collection, I just vault stuff and enjoy it and have it on display at my home and rotate it and collect things. I still obviously enjoy collecting. But you know, it's much harder now because the caliber of items I want to collect it's large sums of money. And I have to be quite selective, to be honest. Because I can't compete with all the bigger players in the current market. However, I obviously have a number of assets that these guys want. So the only way for me to really get into some of the really big, multimillion dollar items is to trade out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat's my collecting career in a nutshell and now I've built up so much expertise in the space that you know, I dibble and dabble in helping the Jordan Brand, do marketing campaigns. I am an adviser to big collectors around the world, helping them build up their collections. I do storytelling in displays around the world with various clients and partners. And I've got my own authentication company SAAS where, just like Public's doing, my main goal is to educate so that people can understand the assets, appreciate the assets, and get a really good sense of the value of the assets, because I think that's quite important. I think that is going to be the key element of this particular space, and actually any collecting space is going to focus on in the next sort of three to five years. It's all going to be about really getting specific, really getting clear valuations of stocks. At the moment, I think things are still bouncing around. But we'll get into that as we go through the question. So that's me and my collection, career from start to end and looking forward.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, sweet as you were saying that I was like, Gerard is living the dream, like the dream of any NBA fan, Michael Jordan fan. He is living it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI wanted to ask you because I think this is really interesting, and also just to give people in the audience a bit more context. Can you talk us through some of like those highlight pieces, those assets that are currently in your collection? Maybe like two or three of your favorite ones? And then also take us through like, how did you even get it? Maybe you can give us like a quick story of an interesting acquisition story.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, I think probably the asset that I own, the pair of shoes I own that people will most likely recognize, is that I own The Shot. So I own the Black Cement Jordan 4s that Michael Jordan wore when he hit the shot over Craig Ehlo of the Cavs. And that for me is definitely in terms of emotional value an asset that captures a really big turning point not just in Michael Jordan's career but in the whole basketball, NBA kind of history. It's, in my opinion, its top three, possibly top one or two moments ever. So that's definitely, in my opinion, the biggest asset that people will really appreciate, I think on a global scale without question.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI own obscure pieces like the Nike Alpha Force that Michael Jordan wore in the same kind of period, as he was wearing Jordan, threes and fours and he was trying to, you know, get comfortable in the shoes. There's some talk about him, it being a transition point, as am I going to stick with Jordan, they're trying different midsole shoes models, and he actually started wearing Nike Alpha force, which isn't the Jordan shoe. But he wore them two or three times, and I have the pair that he played in against the Milwaukee Bucks. So that's a cool, very unique piece, not as big a celebrity as The Shot. But definitely for me, it's a piece that I appreciate a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then you're seeing other other shoes that I would love to have in my collection that have eluded me. I mean, the obvious one, for me is the last shot, which is Michael Jordan's final pair of shoes, which, I mean, I've literally searched for, I mean, I'm a resourceful man. And I've searched for it far and wide. And I mean, there's two pairs out there. And one of them potentially, is that model. But there's also a possibility that Michael Jordan has kept that one himself, which would make sense to me. But it's just not a pair that I've ever been able to acquire. But that would be monumental. And I mean, the closest pair I've seen to that very last pair is actually up at Christie's actually, it's an auction I've held here, the shameless plug, but there is an amazing, low 13 game-worn Michael Jordan sample that's actually on the market as we speak. And that's pretty much as close as I think any of us will get to that last shot ever. And that's, that's an amazing piece.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eWhen you even think to yourself,\u0026nbsp;“I would love to own the last shot piece” or “ the last shot sneaker,” how does that process of even trying to track it down start? Is it all just personal connections? What's that research process?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's, I mean, my process is I mean, everybody knows I'm an actuary by profession. So my mind is quite analytical, I love a good spreadsheet. I love a good list. So over the years, I've basically built databases of you know, where these assets are, whether it's jerseys, shoes, bats, helmets, you know, not necessarily specific to Michael Jordan, but where big assets are, who owns them, you know, their numbers, their emails, some photos of those assets, the tagging just so I can keep myself fully educated as to you know, the authenticity and what I should be looking for.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI do actually have big personal databases that you know, are super valuable to me and help me try to track these things down. And once you get into the circle you know, you do meet insiders, insiders to these athletes, these these these gods so to say, of the world and you can navigate through, there is a there's a way to navigate through that community and figure out how to get out get out assets once you do a deal. Whenever I do deals in the past, it was never you were never buying one item. It wasn't efficient, you were potentially having to get on a plane and travel to Hong Kong or New York and as I said I was based in London in Europe most of the time. So if I was going in, I was going for the kill and I was going to buy as much as I could, you know? And when you get known to be a reliable person who does deals who buys stuff off the medics, the teammates, the ball boys, you know, use that they pass your lap around respectfully and they and you can you know pay the right money for the assets. And at the time it was much simpler like I said they were trying to get rid of assets anonymously without you going to the market. You know, there wasn't really a deep liquid market for them at that point. They also didn't want to be known to be selling the asset that Michael Jordan gave them, so it was much easier. But that's how I go about it and I apply the same technique. Circle still exists, you know, there are other layers, there are more auction houses, there are more dealers, there are more middlemen, but it's just navigating the space. Like any space just like buying a house or a property, it's very similar actually.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, awesome. I want to zoom out a little bit. I know, there's probably a lot of people in the audience who are interested in potentially investing in sports memorabilia, and just learning more about the market in general, could you kind of just quickly define for us, what exactly is the sports memorabilia market, and then what makes this category special?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, sports memorabilia market as an asset, if I was thinking about in a real simple kind of definition, any asset that captures an athlete, either his image or a moment, or an event in sports history. And this can be purely a photo on a card, or an actual item used at that point in time or something with a signature from that era. It's a very broad category, so it captures the essence of an athlete.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s an interesting category because, I mean, for me, first, take one quick step back to make it clear what the following statement means, to me, it's like an art. These are moments that people have created at the very peak of their career. And if anybody on the call has ever, you know, going down that route of being an athlete or doing a sport, you know, it is extremely difficult to work your way up that ladder to become the top person, just like any artists would have had to work, you know, hundreds of 1000s of hours, you know, to be known as the, you know, the Michelangelo or the Picassos of the world, you know, these athletes have created these moments by being that great. So for me, they aren't just rubber and canvas and suede and leather, and you know, and wood and whatever, whatever materials they use in the equipment. They're actual moments in time that represent something very deep, very hard to achieve, and hence, they are pieces of art, which you which become talking points become storytelling points. And that's how I treat it. So to me, it's art. It's the emotional value. It's the moment, it's a historical moment in time that they capture that they represent, that gives them value.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I think to your point, the emotional value is so strong, so strong, right? Like we remember those moments that MJ last game shot and different moments. One thing I'm interested in from the investor perspective, is what are some of the factors, the value drivers, of a certain piece of sports memorabilia? I know you mentioned obviously, the moment, like what it's associated with, the athlete. Is there anything else? Can you kind of just elaborate on what some of those important factors are?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eI mean, those are extremely important facts that you raised. But I think rarity is key, like with any asset. And now the space is becoming much more liquid, and much more, much more educated, people really understand what rarity actually actually means. Now, for me, rarity is literally a handful, you know, and I know there are assets out there. I mean, there is an intersection between demand, and, and supply. And, you know, the perfect example for me is like the card market, the sports card market, there could be 200,000 people who want this one card, and there's only 700 of them, and that seems like a very high demand ratio. And I agree, but actually, ultimate or absolute rarity, where you can have something that like two or three or no other person has, that for me is the ultimate factor. And as we get more educated, we need to know how to filter down to what that rarity actually means. So, in cards, there's, you know, there are populations, there are I mean, you have to think of what is important in the card, what is the emotional value in a card in the card mark is my interpretation. So all the basic stuff about the quality of the card, the centering of the card, you know, the edges of the card, how perfect that card is preserved, those are all very easy parameters to understand. The hard bit is actually delving down to actual rarity and the authenticity and the you know, and the meaning meaningfulness of that card.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I think with cards, the excitement usually comes from, say, pulling a card. So being able to calculate and understand the probability of you actually pulling that card that is going to be a big factor in rarity. Which athlete it was related to, that's going to have a big big driver of value and rarity, you know, within each of those athletes, each of those athletes have one or two cards that are the cards to have actually, they probably will have one card is the card. And if it is\u0026nbsp;the card that is in your basic kind of starting point, this is the card I want for Gretzky or for Mantle or for MJ. And then you have to take that particular card and then filter that particular example down into the best version of that example.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith game used stuff, it's slightly more complex because once it's far more complex, because it's there's you know, authenticating a card is quite simple, because they are just pieces of paper that capture that nostalgia, authenticating and valuing game used jerseys and shoes is there a lot more intricate details to look at tags and where and you go down this angle of the photo matching, and we'll talk about a bit more about photo matching later on. But after photo matching and understanding signatures, it then gets into this kind of moment, space. And up to that photo matching kind of factor that you're considering, the prices on these things will be kept because it's you know, it's just photo matched. And it could be, you know, just a regular season game, but it's photo match, you know, he wore it. So it's great, it's a great asset, but the price will be capped. The moment it's photo matched, but also the moment that it's photo matched to a huge or significant or turning point, then the price will just shoot up. And that's because it's rarity, meaningfulness, emotional value, and, and that's what these assets, you know, that's why those assets then sort of transition from a sports card or sports item into a piece of art and a piece of history. And I think people are getting far more educated. I mean, there are a lot of sports thinkers, kind of like myself and there's lots of people in the market who\u0026nbsp;try to go out there and kind of give these parameters to people and give that kind of food for thought. So they can think about the value themselves. And it is complicated, but I do really feel that the market is getting very sophisticated. And buyers we're getting very sophisticated and very demanding. And that's right, I think, and I actually support that a lot because it gives us base credibility and value.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eYou know, one thing I think that's so interesting, as I was listening to you speak is that, and I think this is a great point also for our audience. As you know, they continue to learn more about alts. And I'm even on my own journey of learning more about alts. And I think every kind of alts category has its own nuances, you know, when it comes to evaluating an asset. So for instance, you gave the example of sports cards where like the grading and the condition of the card is like a huge determinant. There's different determinants when you look at things like the art market or comic book market. And then obviously, sports memorabilia. Could you just elaborate a bit more? You spoke about photo matching, can we start at the beginning? Like what is even photo matching? Can you kind of just explain that whole process, like what does it even mean?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eSo photo matching - this will apply to game used stuff firstly, so you photo match game used items. And what that effectively means is that using images and video for when the asset was actually used. You're effectively able to superimpose the asset you have in your hand on top of the image, and every single crease, loose thread game used blemish, production blemish lines up so that it is absolutely conclusive that the asset you have in your head is the exact asset used by Maradonna or by you know, MJ or by David Beckham. And there is zero doubt there. I mean, it's just conclusively matched and attributed to that particular moment. And then if that moment is a big moment, then that's the next stage of kind of research and value.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Actually, to be honest, and in my opinion, once you've got the photo matched assets, you get so far up the chain. It's the moment that really adds value. You know, and I think, and the uniqueness of that moment moment and, you know, factors that you that the asset has that relate to that moment, you know, for example, I mean, a perfect example of a photo matched asset is something that Public actually have within their portfolio is the Shattered Backboard, Air Jordan 1, which is I mean, I'm obviously biased, because, you know, I was I was involved in that particular transaction some years ago. But that asset has photos of Michael Jordan, taking off his shoes, and giving them to the other athlete. Now, that's just unheard of. And that particular nuance parameter is super important because it not only photo matches the asset to something that MJ would have worn in a big moment, but it also photo matches the backstory and the provenance. So there's, you've conclusively photo matched but also conclusively fact checked, and you have photographic evidence of the backstory and how it actually got from Michael Jordan's feet, to the open market.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd the fact that Michael Jordan was the person handing the asset over is so significant, because usually, it would go into the admin team or his charity team, or, you know, his, you know, there would be a process because he was such a huge, huge, huge athlete, and he was huge from from day one. I mean, people knew he was a big deal from day one. So to have an asset that comes direct from him, insane. And for me, personally, I mean, if I would have value, it's way up there. It's way up there. I mean, Maradonna’s hand of God, and you know, Kobe's rookie jerseys have absolutely nothing on that particular shoe. But it requires a level of understanding and appreciation of what it actually is, you know?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's so interesting. I'm kind of interested to talk and like, get your opinion on what's happening in the market currently. I know, if we look at the top of the market, we saw in 2021, there was the sale of the 1984, Michael Jordan Airships, which kind of set a record at Sotheby's for over $1.4 million. What have we seen happen from that point? I know you alluded to some other things like sports memorabilia sales, just then the hand of God and different things. What are we kind of seeing in the market right now?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah so what is happening here is that the buyers and investors in these particular assets are extremely educated and they know exactly what they need that asset to have for it to be effectively a one of one, or a really big momentous moment. So the hand of God whatever the 9.3 million for that jersey, it makes absolute sense because it doesn't matter what what you do in life or what your interest in life, you know Diego Maradonna is and we know about that moment, and it's not particularly you know, a positive you know, it is a moment that that has a lot of controversy attached to it. And that just makes it a great asset, which is why that value makes sense. And it shows you the capability of some of these assets. You know, the Kobe Bryant rookie jersey is the one that sold for 3.6 and one that sold for 2.6, 2.7 photo matched rookie moment, rookie Jersey, obviously the passing of Kobe has helped those jerseys as well, rest in peace. But it just shows you that people really know what they want, it has to have every single parameter. If you had a photo of I mean, the Hodges who got the jersey from Maradonna is obviously proof a very good provenance, but there's no photo of Diego Maradonna giving the jersey to him, but it's obviously that the exact jersey because it's photo matched, and it was a very easy photo match and a great photo match. But it was such a unique moment. It was easy, but had Diego Maradonna signed that jersey or if there was an image of him, not being able to really speak English and Hodges saying hey, pointing Give me your jersey if that was documented it would be even more valuable. Similar to the Kobe jerseys, if there were other attributes that made it more unique, and that made the story more clear, the value just goes up, you know.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think what's going on the market is people are really buying meaningful stuff. I mean, I can speak more. I think my knowledge is definitely more expert on the memorabilia side. And as a game used memorabilia side, and I think that's what's happening there. And in my view on the card market, is that people are getting more educated on what actual rarity is. And, you know, I think, game used, and cards, there's definitely a vintage, historic and kind of modern market. As always, with cards, I do just think, by default, the vintage market will always be more valuable. But obviously, as time surpasses, you know, the new market becomes vintage, and it will gradually grow. But there are giants in the sports world, and they've been the same giants for many, many years, even with, you know, Kobe Bryant is a good example. And I think, as I said, that's why I said his passing has added value to those particular jerseys.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the Michael Jordan, rookie jersey, you know, if there was a photo match one it would be significantly more valuable than that. And I think a lot of the collectors in the sports space would agree to that. I know Michael Jordan is still alive, but he's not going to create any more of those moments. I mean, I've seen, I've recently seen an amazing asset, which I can't wait until it comes to the market, but I've seen his playoff, his first playoff rookie shoes. And it's\u0026nbsp;a really great photo match. And if, you know, if a Kobe Jersey sells for $3.6 million, I can see when a shoe like that comes to market or just explode that particular value, because it's such an iconic shoe. And it's his very first playoff and it was used in like two or three of the game. So yeah, I think people want the big pieces, the big investment, the big pieces, this is helping the medium and lower side of the market. But I do think that side of the market will stabilize a bit more, and the value will be very clear to everybody. But yeah, so I think what's going on, I think education is going to be key in terms of estimating the values.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, awesome. Okay, cool. I'm going to ask you one more quick question, because I know that we're running over. And I think I think it's such a great point that you make about education. And it's great to hear that, like, as the market is maturing that people, you know, they're getting more educated, they're getting more knowledgeable about these assets. And it's such a great time for the public, for our audience to then kind of come into these categories as well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy final question for you was, you spoke about Maradonna, Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan. These are obviously like Pantheon all time, great athletes, right? When you look at the current kind of crop of athletes who are playing now, are there any that you look at and you think, once they're kind of game used, game worn memorabilia kind of gets out there in the future, it could rival in terms of the sale price? It could kind of rival what we've seen with like, the MJ assets or the Kobe assets or the marathoner assets. Are there any kind of athletes that you look at that will do that?,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah I definitely think they have potential to get up there. This is the will in the basketball world. The Lukas and the Steph Currys, they will get up there. The one thing I will say for the modern athletes, basketball and other sports, is that their game-issued items are much more abundant. So they will be just a much larger supply that also applies to cards as well as a huge supply of modern cards. I do think they can get up there but they literally have to check every single box it would have to be highest scoring game, best playoff run you know you won't really have many multi game worn stuff because of the abundance of the jerseys and stuff for example, but yeah there are definitely are players that will get up there in basketball and football I'm trying to think. Well obviously the Nemars and Mbappes of the world will get up there because there's a direct link there to the Messies and the Ronaldos and the Van Bastens of the world.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut I think more of what would be the thing to look out for is the gods of the other sports where less focus is currently on at the moment. Those are the ones that will come up I think. I mean, I do honestly think basketball will always be Michael Jordan and then the Kobes and LeBrons and the other greats. Boxing will always be, you know, Mike Tyson. You know, the F1 Racing market will always be Schumacher. You know, Lewis Hamilton and Verstappen will be up there, you know, but everybody's going to want to go back to Schumacher. But I think with education and people understanding all the parameters that they're interested in and getting that real one of one meaningful moment, those will be the athletes we need to look out for that will just jump up there. So not necessarily specifically.. well, obviously, they have to be very good athletes in whatever sport they play, but it will be that one of one, this really unique story that makes them valuable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eSuper, super insightful.

I'm your host Kinsey Grant and today's show is brought to you by Tema ETFs. Tema ETFs is an issuer focused on bottom-up investing in unique structural themes like their Lux Ticker, that's the, excuse me, their Lux ETF, that's the ticker $LUX and that's what we're gonna be talking about today with our wonderful guests. I'm so excited to welcome Javier Lastra, who is a PM at Tema ETFs to the Public Podcast. Javier, how are you today?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJavier Lastra: \u003c/strong\u003eHi, good morning to everyone. Thank you for having me on the show.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYes, absolutely. I'm excited to chat with you today. We certainly had a very fun and interesting conversation on deck today. We're going to be talking about investing in luxury, specifically around that $LUX ETF that I mentioned. But I want to start with a little bit of a higher level question here. I want to start with just general luxury as an investing theme. I think often when we, as investors, consider luxury, we're thinking bags, shoes, cars, fancy expensive items that we spend disposable income on, but not necessarily stocks. Now, as the PM of this $LUX ETF, which invests in companies that are operating in the luxury industry, you know, the $LVMH and Mercedes-Benz, et cetera, tell me a little bit more about why this is an appealing sector for retail investors to consider. Why is luxury investing up there with, you know, spending on luxury items? Tell me a little bit more about that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJL: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, sure. I mean, luxury as a theme is a very interesting one from an investment perspective, because there are certain structural tailwinds that help the growth in the space. I think we've all heard many times how, for instance, in Asia, the emerging middle class has been driving the growth of the sector for many years. And there is expectations that will continue to be a tailwind. A sector where it's helped by the fact that, for instance, women, which are the, you know, by and large, the biggest purchases of luxury, they continue to participate in the workforce, they continue to gain further financial freedom, and that's unleashing a lot of financial firepower to spend in luxury goods. We also see across the Western economies that women are also having less kids. That means that there's also increased spending that is unleashed that can be spent, women can spend on themselves. And this is something that is demographically going to help the sector going forward. And that's why we think it's such an interesting thing from an investment perspective.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, certainly, certainly interesting aspects to consider. I like this idea of thinking about the tailwinds that might impact this sector. Now, one question that I have that I'm sure a lot of people listening are probably wondering the same thing. You see headlines all the time that say, you know, an Hermès Birkin bag outperformed the S\u0026amp;P 500 by X amount as an investment over, you know, X number of years. I'm curious why invest in an ETF like Lux instead of investing in the actual item itself, investing in a luxury handbag, a luxury car. Why invest in the stock instead of the thing?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJL: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, an ETF gives you the diversification and the benefit of with one purchase having exposure, not to just one bag, one brand, but you actually get exposure to many different brands, many different objects in many different sectors that actually can, we argue, behave, can behave in a very similar fashion. So, the diversification benefits that bring the fact that you can invest in our fund are not present when you buy an Hermès bag. Clearly, if you're a big fan of Hermès and you want to invest in one, I highly suggest that you do, but I think there are different motivations for it rather than just pure investment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and certainly a little easier to buy an ETF than it is to buy an Hermès bag at the current moment. So I wanna talk about that, that idea that attaining these luxury goods is often something that is not necessarily in the question for a lot of people who might be listening to this at this current moment. We aspire to be luxury consumers, but we might not be in that income tax bracket quite yet. Tell me a little bit about how aspiration plays into luxury as a sector, into its desirability. How does that aspirational quality impact the way that we invest in luxury items and in luxury stocks?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJL: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, this is a very good question. I mean, it comes down to the definition of luxury, right? At the end of the day, if you look at watches, you can either buy a, I don't know, a Apple watch or something even cheaper than an Apple watch, a Seiko or a very standard watch that gives you the time and probably very accurately nowadays. Or you can go all the way to the other end of the spectrum and buy a Patek Philippe, which costs in the tens of thousands of dollars or even sometimes in the hundred thousands of dollars. The reason that you're buying that watch is not because you need the time on your wrist, right? The reason you're buying that watch is because it's giving you a status, it's giving you something that no other object is giving you. And that desirability is really what defines a lot of these luxury items. I've made the example of watches, but I think we can think of cars, we can think of boats, we can think of bags, fashion, shoes, anything. There are many industries where this gets repeated with brands that are positioned in that luxury spectrum, which I think they get defined normally by craftsmanship and desirability. Desirability that usually creates demand over and above the supply of the product. And that's why normally you have this second aftermarket where the prices can even be higher than the actual product when the price of the product is new.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eTotally. And I was just the other day speaking with a co-worker. We had listened to, not to plug another podcast on this podcast, but I had been listening to a podcast about the story of LVMH and the Arnaud family. And it came to my attention that this stable of brands that LVMH has collected are all the kinds of brands that have existed for, in some cases, a century plus and have maintained such staying power. And it's really interesting to consider what the next iteration of those kinds of brands might be that stand the test of time, that have this reputation for craftsmanship and for reliability and for that desirable luxury quality. Those tend to be those aspects that really make a brand something that can stand that test of time. It's a very interesting idea to consider what might be the next version of those companies and something I've just kind of been toying with. And one aspect of that conversation around how a brand creates staying power and maintains that desirability, of course has to do with the economic situation that we are in at any given moment. So that's my segue to talk about how luxury stocks might potentially be, you know, something that are recession proof. Tell me a little bit more about the chatter around the idea that luxury can still stand the test of economic time, if you will, and maintain that desirability, maintain that value, despite what might be going on with GDP or unemployment or any economic indicator, what have you. Tell me a little bit about that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJL: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, absolutely. I mean, this comes from the perspective that the average customer is in an income bracket on a wealth bracket that doesn't really get impacted by economic cycles. And therefore, whether they buy one or two Ferraris or three Ferraris doesn't get decided by which part of the economic cycle we are in. Obviously, there are parts of the luxury space. So when you get to the more aspirational side of it, which we've had a little bit of it in the last two or three years, that is more cyclical. And that's, I think, what we've seen at the moment as inflation has spiked. Some of those aspirational consumers that were able to purchase the first luxury item and the last two or three years, they're no longer there. And that part of the market has already been struggling, I think, for a few quarters. Again, there's a big part of the luxury customer base that in revenue terms, that is, as I said, individuals with wealth and income that are in the top 1%, if not higher. And those are generally quite resilient through the cycle. And that's, I think, what most people that talk about this resilience are referring to. There are some numbers that floated around suggesting that around 20% of the top customers generate around 60% of the total revenues of some of these companies. I think that varies across sectors and across companies, but I think that would be an interesting rule to keep in mind that the top customers, the most wealthy customers tend to account for the vast majority of the revenue generated by these pure luxury companies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eSo with all of this in mind, I'm curious about what you would say to investors who might be considering this space, adding luxury to their portfolios. What would be some of the either homework they should do or questions they should ask themselves before investing in luxury?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJL: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, from a US investor perspective, one of the things that we've highlighted is that the access to some of these companies that we invest in is quite limited. The vast majority of the global luxury consumer groups tend to be either trading outside the United States, or they tend to not have also sponsored ADR. So the access to these investments is limited. I think we've calculated that it's around 70% of the pure luxury place globally are actually not accessible for the average retail investor in the United States. So if you are attracted by this luxury, let's say mega trend that we think is very interesting to tap into. I think you really should consider, I guess, our fund, which is giving you access to that exposure. In terms of the questions you need to ask yourself, obviously, you need to look at your portfolio and look at what your exposures, your asset allocation proportions are. We could be, let's say, bundled into consumer discretionary. But as we've argued earlier consumer discretion generally tends to be a lot more cyclical, whilst our subsectors should be, or sector within consumer discretion, should be a lot more resilient through the cycle for the reasons we discussed earlier. So I think this is an interesting angle they can think of if they are concerned obviously about the economy in the next two or three years or even more short term. So I think the qualities of the space, I think it's something to consider.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eAll right, well, certainly very interesting and has been an illuminating conversation, obvious to understand a little bit better how and why luxury might be a little more, I guess, recession in elastic than maybe people might consider at first glance. So, thank you so much for your time today and for sharing all of this wonderful information with us. I really appreciate it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJL: \u003c/strong\u003eThank you, thanks for having me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eOf course.

Specifically, we're going to talk about how to gauge growth and momentum from reported from public reported data. future growth versus steady slow growth, the difference between growth stocks and value stocks diversification as it relates to growth and value, so we're gonna, it's gonna be a good episode, right? So sit down, put on your listening ears, and let's jump into it. So in my eyes, there are two types of growth. There's financial growth, and there's customer growth. Every three months, publicly traded companies are required to disclose their financials to the public. And usually, a company will report customer data alongside these financials. A good example of this is Disney. They report both their revenue generated from their media and technology business segment, right, Disney Plus, I'm a subscriber, you might be too. That's the financial growth, but they also share the new subscribers that they've added. Right? The customer growth, both of these are important. So how do we begin to understand this kind of growth? What is good growth? And what is bad growth? So the answer for you here, the secret sauce, the magic sauce, year over year, right? This summer did I make more than I did last summer, we're comparing summers because it's irresponsible for us to compare summers to winters, especially from a business perspective. Let's think of an example. If you're a snow cone company, and you're selling snow cones at the beach, you don't want to compare how many snow cones you sold in the wintertime to how many you sold in the summer, right? No one's buying snow cones in the winter, you want to compare apples to apples, that's the year-over-year comparison that we want to be focused on when looking at growth. So publicly traded companies do it the exact same way. They report revenue for this most recent quarter, and they compare it to the revenue they did during the same quarter last year. So let's say a company just reported their earnings results for the quarter. The first thing I'm looking at is the growth in their financials. So specifically, I want to look at this, I want to see the year-over-year growth and the line items on their income statement. I want to look at revenue, operating income, and net profit, I want to see all of these line items moving up and to the right, because if they're not growing their revenue, year over year, they're not growing their operating income near year over year or net profits, there might be a larger underlying problem here. The next thing I'm trying to decipher is where is this growth coming from? or the lack thereof? Right? Is it? Are we growing? And if we're not, but where's it all coming from? Is it coming from net new customers? Or is the company perhaps raising their prices on existing customers? Maybe it's a new product offering or a feature, what is catalyzing the growth that we are analyzing right now, by looking at this, that's going to help us better understand the company's product or service sales cycles if they're speeding up or slowing down, especially during the current macroeconomic climate. So now we understand how growth is defined. We know what line items to look for on the income statement to look for this growth rate, revenue, operating income, and net profit, as well as the different ways to think about growth customers and financials. But now I really want to better understand the speed of growth, right, as well as how the speed of growth might impact the company's valuation and how you might be going about valuing them. So you've all heard of super-fast growth tech companies, I'm sure the ones that are doubling their revenue year over year, they're unprofitable, but they're growing very quickly. Generally speaking, these are defined as growth stocks, right? We might have heard that term on public here or in the headlines, but maybe your friend told you but growth stocks, right, these fast-growing unprofitable companies. However, on the other side of the aisle, we've also heard of the old, tired but very profitable companies who aren't growing, you know, more than call it and mid-single digits every year, but they're doing just fine. And assuming it's undervalued, you can think of those companies as value stocks. So on one side, we get the super fast growing companies, the growth stocks. On the other side, we have the value stocks now. Now you're probably saying which one should I invest in? Well, I can't tell you that but what I can tell you is how you can begin thinking about them. So on one side you have capital appreciation, right? The stock price going up that might come\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAustin Hankwitz: \u003c/strong\u003eWith investing in a growth stock, and then on the other side of the aisle, you have this more stable cash-flowing business that might even pay you a dividend, right? So you get a bit of cash flow and some potential capital appreciation as well. But which one is right for you? So only, you know the edge of that question. Everyone's investing style is unique to them. But if you're thinking it's a growth company, that's great. Let's talk about a few things to help you evaluate which one you might want to look at. So always want to start with the financials, right? It's usually common and maybe even required for a growth company to be growing revenue by about 30%, year over year. If they're not doing that, maybe that's a red flag.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAustin Hankwitz:\u003c/strong\u003e The next thing I want you to look at is their operating income and their profits, right? Are their margins expanding as well, these are all things to consider when you're looking at a company. Don't forget about those customers, though we have growth companies, they tend to be software companies like to report a specific line item called the dollar-based net retention rates, you might not see this on any financial statements, but it'll likely be brought up in an earnings call or some sort of shareholder letter. Again, that's the dollar-based net retention rates, this usually means that they're able to keep and upsell the customers every year on new products. This number is normally above 100%. But every company is different. These companies also like to report the number of customers that have purchased big contracts for them. So we definitely want to be seeing that number go up, right? The big, big spending customers thumbs up there. But what about the value stocks now, right, we talked about growth, let's talk about evaluating these value stocks. So same deal, you want to think about financials and you want to think about customers, financials, aka revenue, it's probably growing mid-single digits, they're likely cash flowing a bunch of money, right, because they're old and they pay ran for a while they're likely profitable at this point. So free cash flow is likely increasing. And as free cash flow increases, there may be paying down debt, they might be reinvesting that back into the business through capital expenditures, they might be buying back shares, or even paying you a dividend. If a company is paying a dividend, something I want you to look for is growth, right? The continual growth over a long period of time of that dividend. For example, there are companies on the stock market who have been paying and growing their dividend every single year for the last 50 years. They're actually dubbed the dividend kings. And they're really interesting to learn about if you're into that sort of thing. Now, from a customer's perspective, for the value companies, it's probably a similar story, right? Mid-single-digit growth with nothing too crazy happening behind the scenes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAustin Hankwitz:\u003c/strong\u003e Alright, so now you're probably saying to yourself, I've got growth stocks, I understand, you know, the capital appreciation that goes with them. They're unprofitable, they won't be paying a dividend. We got the value stocks, I understand those as well. But which one is right for me? Which one should I be thinking about? So in my opinion, that all comes down to risk tolerance. Again, I cannot tell you what to do. Neither am I telling you what to do. But this is what I do personally. So I think about my core companies, and I think about my satellite companies. So let's start with the core. My core companies are those value stocks, right? They've been around for decades, they're incredibly profitable, spitting out cash dividends, every quarter, all the boring stuff that you're not going to see in the headlines. But I like that, you know, that makes up a good 60-65% chunk of my investment portfolio. I like to have a good solid chunk in these tried and true companies. So on the other side of that aisle now is the satellite companies, right? Think of this as like little satellites that are orbiting the Earth, right? The earth is all the core companies and these little satellites are the growth stocks. I have exposure to them, especially the ones I'm most intimately familiar with and, you know, keep up with but I'm not betting the farm on them by any stretch of the imagination, they're not profitable, and they still have a lot to prove, etc, etc. So I don't want to be too crazy here. So as you think about diversifying your portfolio, keep that in mind. Think about your risk tolerance, think about your goal as an investor as well as how it all comes together to help you reach financial freedom.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAustin Hankwitz:\u003c/strong\u003e For all of those of you that stick around this entire time.

I'm super pumped to be back doing these 15-minute fundamentals shows on Public Live. You guys enjoyed season one so much. We had to come back and hit you with the season two. So I am pumped. Welcome to 15-minute fundamentals on Public Live. This is the show where we break down investing strategies and concepts so you can be a better investor. I'm your host Austin Hankwitz and I create personal finance and investing content online. I have a degree in finance and economics, and I did mergers and acquisitions for a publicly traded healthcare company for a few years out of college. So long story short is I'm a nerd, and I embrace it. As a reminder, this show is for educational purposes only. And this is not direct investing advice.

Go check it out. public.com/premium.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAustin Hankwitz: \u003c/strong\u003eSo this is the episode right? This episode is all about earnings interpretation. Specifically, what are quarterly earnings reports, the specific information that is shared during these events, and how to go about interpreting them for the first time. So with the groundwork being laid, let's get after it. Kicking things off with what exactly is a quarterly earnings report, right. So if you're watching CNBC right now, or scrolling your public feed, you've likely been reading a lot of financial data. And there's a lot of headlines being thrown at you right now, specifically, as it relates to these publicly traded companies, right? Maybe you've seen someone saying this company came in above expectations and their stock is flying because of it, or this company came in below expectations and their stock is sliding. There's a lot of information being thrown around right now. So let's work together to not only interpret it, but to also think through how it might impact your portfolios.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAustin Hankwitz:\u003c/strong\u003e Starting at the beginning, right, a publicly traded company is a company whose stock can be bought or sold on the stock market, we all know that we all have brokerage accounts, we get that, right. So think Disney, Amazon, Nike, all that fun stuff. But because these companies are open to the public in the sense that anyone can buy and sell their stock, they have a few responsibilities to uphold as made possible by the SEC, one of those responsibilities is disclosing audited financial information to their investors, right. This is anyone who owns the stock, you, me and everyone else. And so in efforts to do this as efficiently as possible, these publicly traded companies released something called quarterly earnings reports to their public every three months. Because we talk about what's inside of them and how to interpret them, it's important to know where to actually find these things, right. So if we're going to talk about something, I don't want to just say it and then you guys go be puzzled on where to find it. So here are two places where to find this information. Two places where to find these quarterly earnings reports. The first is straight from the SEC website, the Securities and Exchange Commission's website sec.gov. There's a way to search a company name. And, you know, you can read through all the quarterly earnings releases things called like an Edgar, something like that. But you know, be sure to keep an eye out actually for the reports that are labeled as 10 Q's, right? Look for the 10 key of this 8k, 10k, observe the different things, look for 10 Q, that's what you want.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAustin Hankwitz:\u003c/strong\u003e The second place to find this information is actually on the company's Investor Relations website. So if you're visiting a website, a company's website, it might be hard to find you like the little tab board, it might not just be apparent. So what I do personally, to find this like section of the company's website, is I google the name of the company. So say Amazon, for example, and then the words investor relations after their name. And then I click enter into Google, and the Investor Relations website is usually like one of the first ones to pop up on Google. So once you're in there, you'll be able to find all these earnings reports that we're going to be talking about. So we know what quarterly earnings are, and where to find them. But how should we begin interpreting the information? Right? How should we be approaching this?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAustin Hankwitz: \u003c/strong\u003eSo let's first start here with what is actually being shared. And there are two things in particular. So the first kind of bunch of things that are being shared here are the financial statements, right, there are three financial statements that you should expect when a quarterly earnings report is being shared. And these three financial statements are all you need as it relates to understanding the financial health of a company, you've got the balance sheet, the income statement, and the cash flow statement. So starting with the balance sheet here, this is where you'll be able to find a company's assets, their liabilities and their owner's equity. Essentially, you know how much money the company has in the bank or the balances of the short and long-term debts as well as the value of their assets like property, equipment, and other tangible and intangible items. Most investors get overwhelmed by all the information shown on this financial statement. I certainly did when I was starting out. So I'll tell you a few things to look for, in particular when your favorite company reports their earnings so you don't feel too overwhelmed.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAustin Hankwitz: \u003c/strong\u003eThe first thing I want you to look for is something called net debt. If the company had to pay back all of their debt to their lenders tomorrow with cash, could they do it right now Oh, that is net debt. Another ratio that I like to look for is something called the current ratio, which is essentially, it takes a company's total assets and compares it to their total liabilities, right? So do they have more assets than they have liabilities? And if they do, that's usually a good thing, right? So net debt, if they had to pay back all their debt tomorrow with cash, could they do it, and then that current ratio, assets versus liabilities.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAustin Hankwitz:\u003c/strong\u003e So now the income statement. So now we're going to the income statement here, this is probably the most important financial statement of the bunch, at least I think. So This financial statement tells you how much revenue and profit a company made during the quarter, as well as their margins, their expenses, and other key financial insights that you will need when evaluating a company in a business here. So here are a few key items, line items that I want you all to look into when you're reviewing and interpreting the income statement. Right. So we did this with the balance sheet. Now income statement, here's a couple of those line items. The first one here is revenue, right, which appears as maybe sales or net sales or as a couple of names, but it's just you know, how much money is coming into the business, right revenue, money made from selling products and services. Now, a good sign to observe with this line item, in particular, is that it's growing year over year. And usually you'll see a company include last year's same-period financials right up next to this periods to make it easier for you to compare and contrast the growth. So revenue, great ones to the growing. Next up is gross margin. This is a line item gross margin. This is how much actual profit the company's making by selling their product or service. This figure is usually distilled down and interpreted as a percentage. So just take that gross profit margin number then divided by the revenue and you'll get a percentage like, oh, yeah, I've got you know, 82% profit margins like that. That's kind of like what I'm kind of talking about here. Right? So they'll give you the raw gross margin number, but it's up to you then to see what is that percentage margin by comparing it then to that revenue figure. You'll also want to see this figure remain around the historical norms or grow, right, we don't want to see a company's gross profit margins declining, right? That's not a good sign. However, you do not want to see, right, this number decrease. We don't want to do that historical norms coming up, go up and down with seasonality, but never to really see it take a plummet like that. Right. So the last line item here on the income statement to look out for is the after tax profits. This is called net income. We obviously want after tax profits of the companies we're investing into to increase year over year.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAustin Hankwitz:\u003c/strong\u003e So we have the balance. We have the balance sheet, we have the income statement. Now finally, let's talk about the cash flow statement. Right? This is my favorite because I believe cash is king, especially as it relates to running and growing a business. Now, this statement tells us about how much cash came into the business. Where that cash came from, did it come from selling products? Did it come from taking on a bunch of debt, right where the cash came from? So how much came in where it came from, as well as how much cash left the business? Right? So for me, I like to keep an eye on the cash flow from operations line item, it tells you how much money the business made by operating its business, right? So it's like, okay, for the last three months, right, because its quarterly earnings report, cash from operations, here's how much cash came into the business by operating our business pretty straightforward. You want to see this figure move up, year over year as well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAustin Hankwitz:\u003c/strong\u003e So now let's round all of us off with the second idea here the earnings call right so we covered the financial statements, all the hard facts, but what about the conference call, where Wall Street analysts get a chance to ask questions. So alongside the financial statements, the CEO and other chief executives at a company will sit down and host something called an earnings call. During this conference call, they'll expand further upon their financial results provide guidance as to where they think their company is headed in the near term, as well as answered questions asked to them by analysts on Wall Street. Now, here's the important stuff to remember with these earnings calls to financial statements that the publicly traded companies shared with us are one thing, these are the hard numbers. But more importantly, it's only a snapshot of a specific moment in time for the company, right, the company's financial results for that quarter to snapshot in time a good picture. The earnings call, on the other hand, allows us the investor to get a more realistic and more importantly updated point of view on the company and where things might be headed. Right. So during this time, we're able to hear from their chief executives also about non-GAAP generally accepted accounting principles, operating metrics, like remaining performance obligations for SaaS companies, or perhaps a backlog of purchased equipment for manufacturing companies, or maybe even the executives best guess on what the economy might have in store for us given their first-party customer data. You'll see a lot of bank stocks give us kind of updates on the economy because they're seeing what people are spending their money on. It's important to tune into these earnings calls as investors not only to hear about the intricacies of the financial data shared but also how have the ability to learn more about the information that is not shared in those financial statements, right? The non-GAAP operating metrics, you know if it's the RPO’s or the SAS companies with backlogs are that other added color around the economy that these companies, these executives rather want to share with us. Also a little side quest here and this is what I like to do for fun. Again, nerd, if you want if you're more of a visual learner, right? Most of these companies actually create a investor presentation, a PowerPoint presentation, essentially, where they take their financial and operating results and turn them into beautiful graphs and images, and all that fun stuff. And you can usually find these investor presentations on their Investor Relations website. But don't be surprised if the company you're looking for doesn't offer presentation. Because again, it's not like required for them to make that it's only you know, for fun.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAustin Hankwitz: \u003c/strong\u003eSo yeah, there you go.

I'm your host Ann Berry and we are always diving in together to the latest from the world of investing. Today, we are focused on energy transformation and what it means to be an investor in this space. Joining me as our guest today is Yasmine Dayha Bilger who is the head of ETFs at Engine No. 1. Yasmine, welcome to Public Llive.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmin Bilger: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThanks so much for having me.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI would love to jump right in Yasmine and learn more about what Engine No. 1 is focused on besides sounding like a fire station. But perhaps appropriate given the topic? Could you just walk our audience through what you do, who you all are and what it is that you guys are focused on?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmin Bilger: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAbsolutely. And in fact, you are right on the fire station piece. So\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003epretty good image. But absolutely. So number one is an investment firm that is focused on identifying and investing around what we believe are large scale transformational investment themes. We're a firm founded by former hedge fund and private market investors and have a background in deep fundamental analysis. We launched a little over two years ago, and I think are probably best known for our activist campaign in which we successfully placed three people on the board of directors at ExxonMobil.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd I think, actually, the campaign was quite interesting, because it reflects, I think, two things that really sit across the entire firm, really pillars of what we do. The first is that we were able to do that while only owning five basis points of the company. Well, the reason we were able to was because we focused all of our arguments and recommendations on why they were additive to long term shareholder value, which allowed I think other investors to vote alongside of us. And I think what it shows is, if you've grabbed your thinking in economics, you can accomplish quite a lot in the public markets.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe second that I think is kind of reflective of what we do is that we're an engagement focused company. And usually in the space of climate, the mantra is, if you don't like it, you don't own it. So most climate strategies don't own the largest emitting sectors, the largest emitting companies – we very much own and deeply engage.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd so just to sort of unpack that a little bit more, first of all, as an activist with less than five basis points of ownership to to effect that change, Yasmin, it really brings to life what you say by actively engaging.\u003c/span\u003eLet's talk a little bit more into the work that Engine No. 1 is doing specifically on the topic of energy transformation. It's a really buzzy topic, everyone's talking about it. I'm just back from Davos, Yasmin, where climate and energy transformation was just a huge focus area. Help us cut through the jargon. What does energy transformation really mean, in your context?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmin Bilger:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Yeah, absolutely. So there are a number of reasons why we see a significant move towards decarbonization across our energy systems. Now, with that said, I think it's really important to note that we, as many other people believe that we continue to have a real near term need for fossil fuels. So that's really the transformation we're talking about. It's not a light switch. And I'd also say a lot of people talk about this as the energy transition. And there's so many terms that goes around. To us, that sort of implies a one to one move from traditional fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources. But this is much more about truly a transformation of our entire energy system, and will take decades to play out.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd you did mention it's an enormous investment opportunity. By some estimates, it will require somewhere between $3-5 trillion of investment per year to meet Net Zero targets. So the opportunity creates a lot of investment opportunities, in fact, and they're not just in one sector, when people traditionally think about the energy sector. They really do span our entire economy. I will say I think the opportunity in my opinion is a little misunderstood. I think as I mentioned, the traditional thinking and climate is if you don't like it, you don't own it. So what does that really mean?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMost people tackling climate from an investment perspective, almost definitively have no exposure to traditional oil and gas companies, for example, are basically not exposed at all to the largest sources and uses of energy. We flip the entire conversation of this theme on its head. But just as a set stat to give this to life to people, nearly 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions just come from three segments of our economy, energy, agriculture and transportation, that is the heart of the energy transition. And in our opinion, to drive that sort of decarbonisation at scale, you really need to go where the emissions are. And I think it's the transformation of these various systems that we'll see both, you know, a meaningful reduction in carbon emissions, but also huge investment opportunities for people looking to take advantage of some of the dollars that are being put to work in these spaces.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo just to really drill into that, Yasmine, to make sure that there's no ambiguity here. So the ETF that you have, together at Engine No. 1 one does or does not include the stocks of what we people might think of as the more traditional carbon focused energy production companies.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmine Bilger: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNo, we absolutely do our energy\u0026nbsp; transition focus strategy. Net Z absolutely has exposure to the companies that we believe are leading and benefiting from the transformation, which include companies exactly in those segments. I mean, if you think about it, if three-quarters of emissions are coming from the systems themselves, the leaders and incumbents as well as the enablers within these systems will be the companies that actually should benefit most from it. And so we do actually own traditional oil and gas companies, we own auto companies, we own agriculture companies. Now with all that said, these are the companies that are making the investments and have the I'd call it a short, medium and long term strategies to think about how they win in a world with lower carbon emissions. So they're absolutely focusing on the theme. But I think there's a lot of misunderstanding about where the opportunity lies from a company perspective.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThat's a really interesting clarifying point, Yasmine, because I do think that there is this bias or this general perception that when you see instruments out there focused on energy transformation, they tend to exclude some of those traditional players. And just, you know, as an observation that we've seen, you know, in our discussions on public life, a lot of these energy, traditional energy stocks have done quite well, performance wise recently. So it's so interesting that you guys are not shying away from those rather, instead, including those.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou've been very enthusiastic and emphatic about the fact that energy transformation, as you've defined it, is positioned to be an impactful opportunity and it's going to touch a myriad of industries. You talked about the three largest, can you just unpack for us a little bit more? It was transportation, agriculture, and energy as the biggest pockets of opportunity. But within that, where are you seeing key trends?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmine Bilger: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAbsolutely. So maybe I'll say two things up front. In order to best take advantage of this opportunity, I have two beliefs. One, I think this is absolutely the space for active investment. I think you need to manage your hunting for the best opportunities across this value chain. Secondly, I think you need to be thinking broadly about the opportunity beyond just one sector, you need to be looking at the largest producers and consumers of energy and thinking about how these systems evolve. So maybe two examples to bring that to life. Transportation is a huge source of emissions. Now, most investors when they think about the opportunity and transfer, transportation are really thinking about the move to electric vehicles, and are solely focused on the automakers as they make a push to electrify their car fleet. Now, that is absolutely part of the opportunity.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHowever, the real broader investment opportunity is much, much wider than that. You also need to think about the elements that are required to accomplish that electrification. So with that broader view, you would be looking at spaces like the metals and inputs that are required to produce batteries such as Lithium, for example. You would be thinking about the companies that are required to extract those metal metals, like mining equipment companies. You would also be thinking about the transportation of those inputs to battery plants, so you know what companies would benefit from this change in transportation. And I think the broader framing is much wider in that we play across that ecosystem and are sort of looking on a short, medium and long term basis for where we think the best opportunities lie.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnother area maybe to highlight would be in agriculture. I think one of the interesting areas within agriculture is just precision agriculture. This is really about giving technology to farmers to be more precise and efficient in their usage of fertilizer and other chemical inputs in the farming process, which is one of the largest sources of emissions and farming. So the companies that are leading in this space are not only helping to reduce emissions by increasing efficiency and how we use these chemicals, but they're also saving farmers and therefore their customers on input costs. So this is a really interesting example of almost what you think of as a win win win. It's good for the company playing in this space, because it should lead to increased market share. It's good for farmers, and it's obviously good for the environment if we're being more precise and how we use these inputs.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLet's talk Yasmine, a little bit too, about the engagement work and sort of go full circle, you know, you opened with what you've done in effectuating change at ExxonMobile., What is your approach to working with companies? What's your process? What's your ideation process to then how you engage with the company to then how you affect change?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmine Bilger: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, it really comes down to taking all of this with an investment foot view. So we're an engagement focus firm. What does that mean? That means in our opinion, whether you own one share, or you own an entire company, you're an owner. Now, most engagement that happens in the asset management community, in my opinion, is really coming from the perspective of quantity, talking to as many companies as possible about as many issue areas.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd you see that, for example, and a lot of stewardship reports that come out at the end of the year from asset managers who say, you know, we talked to 25% more companies this year, therefore, we had more engagement. We take a very different approach, we go very deep and very focused, and we're working directly with the companies that we think are really impactful in the spaces that we operate in. So for example, in the energy transition space, what meets the bar for engagement? Well, first, it's deep fundamental work. We're trying to understand where some of these areas around decarbonization link to an unlocking of value. And secondly, it's about, you know, really working closely with the C suite of many of these companies to help them think about affecting their strategy.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI think the goals can be really wide ranging on one end, it's simply accountability. You know, these are hard strategies to execute for public companies that are focused on quarterly earnings, where these are much longer term strategies in nature. But there's also an acceleration component. Many of the parts of this transition really involve impediments and bottlenecks to the strategic plan. So we sit across the entire ecosystem, and I think can offer some valuable perspective on how best to achieve these long term goals.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThen there's transformation, you know, companies that are not on the right path, we think, to maximize shareholder value in a world that's decarbonizing and so there's, there's really opportunities there, too, that maybe worth highlighting to bring it to life. Maybe just to play on some of the spaces we talked about. We've actually been working really closely with a number of the executives at large automakers as they think about how to reach their EV goals, given the challenges around creating batteries. And so helping them think through how to source the input parts and how to sort of think about their overall approach to battery plants, and then how to execute on the long term goal of electrifying their fleet.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe second was really building upon what we've done in oil and gas, which is we've worked with several large oil and gas companies on helping them to measure and ultimately reduce their methane emissions. Most people don't know this, but methane is something like 80 times more potent than CO2, and so has a really meaningful impact when you reduce it. But in all of these cases, since our Exxon engagement, they have all been very collaborative. I think many management companies really welcome the engagement and I think really appreciate the approach we take, which is really focused on how to think about this from a shareholder value lens.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYasmine, this is a question coming a little out of left field, but it really is on this topic of engagement and how retail investors can do that. You know, I go to my mailbox, and I often you know, I get shareholder vote, correspondence where I hold stocks, what can the average retail investor do? And to your point who doesn't have the kind of huge holdings where you typically see more engagement? What can they do to have their voice heard with these kinds of companies?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmine Bilger:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e I love this question, because to me, this is one of the most interesting trends happening in investment management. The reality is that our whole public market system is centered around the shareholder. Now, as an individual investor, you own a very small piece, but actually, collectively, individual investors own a tremendous amount of the public markets. In fact, the three largest passive firms in the world own about 20 to 25% of the average S\u0026amp;P 500 company, and who are their beneficial holders? Well as individual investors, in many cases.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhat I think the first thing to do is actually understand the system altogether, there's 10s of 1000s of votes that come up that public companies, and I'd say about 500 of them are actually focused in areas around the environment, social issues, governance issues, issues that may be really important to you as an investor. And I think it's really first and foremost understanding that. Secondarily, it's understanding how your manager’s voting, you know, you get to pick and choose where you put your money. And I think now there's certainly more choice in the space around managers who may have a\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003edifferent approach to how they support or not support certain proposals that come up for vote at companies. These are happening every year - so I do think a little bit more of knowledge is power. And I think this is actually going to be a really important trend for the next coming years, as retail investors understand that they actually collectively do own a lot of the largest companies in America.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIt's exciting, it's exciting to hear that there's a way to do these things. And then just last question Yasmine, which is, you know, supply chain strategy. We saw so much disruption, I know, that's something that you had Engine No. 1, have filed as a thematic to do something so just closing thoughts and a little more about that.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmine Bilger:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Yeah, we're very excited about this one. This also fits into the bucket of the types of themes we invest in, which are really all about themes that are, you know, long duration and nature, large scale and their size, and I think maybe not perfectly are really understood by the markets. If you think about supply chains, where we're going really has to do with where we've been, which is for the last, you know, let's call it 40 years, companies have been really focused almost exclusively on one thing in their supply chains, which is minimizing cost. And as a result of that, they've moved large portions of their supply chain overseas to lower cost regions, and in many cases, you know, eliminated redundancies and supply chains.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNow, what has this done, this has made supply chains more fragile, it's meant that companies are unable to meet supply spikes, and to really be responsive to demand in fact. And so what are we seeing, we're seeing a huge move to re-localizations of supply chains, which has wide reaching implications. This will have investment implications across spaces like manufacturing, automation and innovation, as we think about some of the types of things that are coming back to the U.S. and places like transportation as we think about disrupting how we move goods. And also probably means more jobs in the U.S, so this is a theme we're very excited about. It's actually in our opinion, linked very closely to the idea of the energy transformation, they sort of go hand in hand and this is another kind of example of where we see a pretty pretty big investment opportunity that lies in front of us. In fact, just to put some numbers on it for folks, during COVID companies lost something like $3.5 trillion dollars because of their supply chain disruptions, so this is a conversation truly about economics.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhat conversation that was, Yasmine - just incredible to have you on.

I'm your host Nora Ali. And today, we are talking about goal setting and, more specifically, how the types of goals you have might shape your investing strategy. With us today to discuss all of that is Taylor Sohns, a Co-founder of LifeGoal Investments. life goal is an ETF issuer focused on helping everyday Americans reach their financial goals with funds like the H O M ETF, which is focused on showing investors what dollars they have allocated for a downpayment on a future home purchase. Taylor, welcome. Thanks so much for having me, Nora. I am super excited to be here. Awesome. Great. We love the enthusiasm. So Taylor, let's start with two common types of goals that might ladder into different investment strategies, and that is retirement and non-retirement. First of all, how and why are these strategies and risk tolerance? Is tolerance is different for these types of goals?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTaylor Sohns: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's a great question. And I am going to start off by saying that I am young. I am a 34-year-old millennial, just to give context to listeners, I'm probably in the same seat that a lot of them are in. So, Nora, great question. Right out of the gates, there are two vastly different buckets that need to be separated mentally and physically, if you will, between the retirement bucket and the non-retirement bucket. And so it's funny, I spend some time on social media as a millennial. And the echo chamber that you hear is the following quote by Warren Buffett. So Buffett says, quote, unquote, \"the best thing to do is buy 90% in an S\u0026amp;P 500 Index Fund,\" period. And then that goes away. And what they don't say what they fail to mention is that later in the conversation, Buffett also states \"if you're not willing to own a stock for 10 years, don't even think about owning it for 10 minutes.\" And so that is the investing quote in its entirety. And people look at just the front end of this. And so Warren Buffett would never ever, ever tell someone with short or intermediate-term assets that are not in retirement plans to go out and roll the dice than the s\u0026amp;p 500. That is absolutely laughable and something that he would never do. So at the end of the day, what we always talk to people about is literally setting up two different strategies. One is your retirement account. And that's likely set aside with your employer, whether it's a 401K, a 403B, 457, whatever it may be, and then you have your brokerage assets on the other side. And what we talk about, people is literally write down, I don't mean that mentally writing down, I mean physically writing down your plan for both of these two different buckets. So I'll give an example of what I have written down literally right in front of me about my brokerage account. And then I'll tell you differently what I have written down as my plan for my retirement bucket. So my brokerage account is in this is written, and I go back to this often. So this says, my brokerage account dollars are there to outpace inflation; anything additional is a bonus, and I will remain diversified and actively tweak the allocation to take advantage of market opportunities, with the emphasis always being on preserving my money. This account is for singles and maybe an occasional double, but never a strikeout. And that's very, very important. Because in a brokerage account, that are assets that will be used in your everyday life, whether it be two or three years out, you're buying a car, a home, your kids going to school braces, whatever it may be, you can't afford to take on all the risks that you can in your retirement bucket. So conversely, this is what I have written down for the thesis on my retirement account. I'm invested for the long term; I'm willing to take on more risk. Because my time horizon is longer. I will remain diversified but tend to be more aggressive without trying to hit home runs. No strikeouts here, either. And so that's how I think about things. Again, you have two totally different time horizons. And when you're investing, time horizon is the absolute emphasis on what determines how you allocate those assets. Shorter term means more conservative, and less aggressive, longer term means you're able to be more aggressive, but only if you're able to stomach the ups and downs in the market, which is a very important point as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNora Ali: \u003c/strong\u003eThat's great. I like the idea of writing down your goals because then it just reminds you of the purpose of each of, your buckets. You mentioned time horizons. Can you give us a little bit more detail as to how you go about figuring out what your time horizons are for your different buckets and your approach to that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTaylor Sohns: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, that's super important. Obviously, you need to know what your money is set aside for. And so, just like writing down a mission statement for the actual investments, before that, you need to sit down and write down what your goals are, again, your retirement assets are set aside; you're not touching those till you're 65 years old. And that's why your shorter-term investments are really important to understand what it is that you're investing for. So at the end of the day, you may have an emergency bucket, and you should have an emergency bucket. And that's called xix, nine months set aside in cash or cash, like security stuff, that's not going to bounce around in case you lose your job, in case you decide to step away from your role and start a new company like I did, whatever it may be, but after that, then you need to think, Okay, I have access income, and therefore I have money to put in a brokerage account. What are the intentions of those assets? What's happening in my life that may dictate where those dollars go? And the advice on our end is always to err on the side of caution. Right. I didn't necessarily think that five years ago that I was going to launch LifeGoal Investments. But I had a very good job that made a very good income. I worked at Wall Street. And at one point, I said, \"Okay, enough is enough of this. I want to go out and try to build a company to help the masses as opposed to the mass affluent that I was working with in the past.\" And my paycheck went to zero. That wasn't anticipated. And I'm very, very glad that I erred on the side of caution, focused more on the short term, focused more on, hey, I don't necessarily know what's to come in my future. And with that, I'm going to remain more conservative, as opposed to remaining more aggressive. And in 2022, obviously, this has come home to roost in spades. It doesn't matter what you've been invested in. Now granted, the more aggressive the worship, then but even the modest bond exposure that people have that think about, you know, sleepy, old, boring old bonds have sold off some as well. So if you're investing, you need to know what your goal is, what you're going to do with that money, or what the unknown for that money might also be. And then, you go about writing your mission statement as to how you're investing that money.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNora Ali: \u003c/strong\u003eWe hear that term diversification a lot when it comes to investing. So from your perspective, Taylor, what are the core tenets of diversification that investors should be wary of specifically when they're thinking about goal setting?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTaylor Sohns: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, diversification can be a laughable topic. Because people look at diversification, they say, Hey, I own three different ETFs, I'm diversified, and that the two most popular on social media that I see talked about all the time, and nothing against these, but I'll tell you why you don't want to own them in the way people own them. So Vanguard is vastly popular on social media. So you look at Vanguard's S\u0026amp;P 500 V O., and then people say I'm diversified, I own VO, and I own VTI--Vanguard's total stock market index. What's funny about those two things is when you look at the correlation between them, and I'll discuss that in a second, they correlate at 99%, meaning they do the exact same thing at all times in the market. So the markets going up, they go up in unison. When it comes down. Unfortunately, they come down. And in essence, that is the antithesis. That is the opposite of what diversification really means. To understand diversification, you have to look at how things correlate together; how things correlate is a statistical analysis. And this isn't something you have to do on your own. Thankfully, we could all be, you know, in a terrible spot if we did. There are websites online where you can look at the correlation between different holdings. But essentially, what you want to do is you want to put together different assets, whether it be stocks, bonds, commodities like corn and oil, gold, and real estate, a combination of those things that have low correlations to each other. So let's look at stocks and bonds. Over time, stocks and bonds have a very low correlation. Call it somewhere between zero mean, they don't do anything the same 2.3%. And what that does, is in a strong market, where the economy is churning, and results in an really strong economic backdrop, your stocks are going to really do well. And your bonds might not do as well--they certainly aren't going to keep pace. That's not what they're meant to do inside of your portfolio. But in a year where we hit a recession, stocks are likely to sell off. And the low correlation with bonds proves to be essential. Bonds have a historical performance of doing very well during a recession. For context here, I'll give you some real numbers. Right, the last real recession we had, I'm not calling 2020 to the 45 or 2020 to 45 minutes session we had there as a recession. But look back in 2008 and 2008, it was a disastrous year for the market. We didn't even know if our economy was going to be able to hold up our banking system was gonna hold up. And with that the S\u0026amp;P 500 sold off 37%, down 37%. And at one point, it was down 49% throughout the year, that year, bonds returned 5.4%, which is above their long-term average. So obviously, that's when you want to have that yin and yang of stocks and bonds in your portfolio at the same time. Now, let's fast forward to this year. 2022 has been a really tough year. Inflation has driven almost all assets downward. So what do you do in that scenario? Well, a different leg of that stool has held up pretty darn well this year. So you've had stocks sell off at one point, they were down 25%, the S\u0026amp;P 500. The NASDAQ was down 35%, almost bonds have sold off as well. This is the worst year bonds have ever had. Bonds right now for the year are down about 12%. The worst year they've had in history going back to 1976, when the bond aggregate was put together, was down 3%. So this is almost a five time multiple of how bad bonds have ever been. But stocks and bonds haven't worked. What has worked is commodities. Commodities have worked in an inflationary environment, look at oil this year, it's been a very, very good asset to be in to hold up when stocks and bonds have sold off. So again, the basis and the crux of diversification comes down to how assets correlate with each other. And what you want to do is put together different assets inside your portfolio that have low correlation to each other going out and buying VTI. And VO is not diversification going out and buying Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon--is not diversification. They all go up and down on days together. And that is not what you want to do. When you look at an overall diversified portfolio. You want to put together the pieces on the outside that have that low correlating asset to them to have something holding up inside of your portfolio at all times. How do you go about phasing out the allocation of these different asset classes? It totally makes sense and diversifying across bonds, equities, and commodities, but how do you determine the right balance? Or, I guess, how do you start figuring that out? So so that's where it gets tough. Right? So that's where it goes back to the original conversation, what are we investing for? Is this the retirement assets that we're investing for, and therefore, you're going to be disproportioned? If you're young, you're going to be disproportionately weighted towards stocks, which are the higher risk, higher rewarding asset over time, or are these your short and intermediate term assets, in which case bonds should be the bulk of the portfolio because they're more stable, again, the worst year they've had prior to this year, and their history over the last 50 years is down 3%. the predictability of bonds is what you're looking for over time. So at the end of the day, what you need to do is have your goals, understand what the money is built for, then understand the mission that you've written down and what your intention with the investment is, and then allocate accordingly. And if you're not able to allocate accordingly, because maybe you don't have the expertise, or the time or the interest, which is, you know, there's a lot of smart people out there that are way smarter than me that just don't have the interest in finance, then you need to go out and find another solution. And so when you think about other solutions, what does that look like, doesn't look like rolling the dice on, again, a couple individual ETFs, that you don't know how they correlate together, because they've all gotten smoked this year. But, you know, selfish plug here, you look at what we do at LifeGoal Investments, my background, and the company's background was working at Wall Street. So we would go around and work with ultra-high net worth people that have sometimes $50 million to invest and put together a portfolio for them. What we did when we decided to get away from that and start life goal investments was sent to ourselves, what does the person that makes $50,000 a year, whatever the number is, that has $5,000 to invest, and want to invest it for a three 510 year timeframe. What do they do, that don't have the interest in going out and plugging together all these pieces for them? And this came from the catalyst for all this. The genesis was people coming to us, our friends, and saying, Hey, I have seven grand to invest, what should I do? And we're like, Well, what do you want to do with it? I might use overthe next five years. Okay, question mark, then what do you do? And so what we did was takeall of that sophisticated portfolio composition that we did for the ultra-rich, and we justpackaged it inside of one ETF. It's called a multi-asset ETF. Each of our ETFs have stocks, bonds, commodities and real estate embedded within them, instead of one single ticker symbol. You can buy it for $10 a share on any platform like Public.com. And so that's what we've done. And we've said, hey, we understand people don't have the interest the time or the education potentially to do this. Let's give it to them inside of one package that they can access easily.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNora Ali: \u003c/strong\u003eLet's talk about losing. You know, because we've all done that this year, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTaylor Sohns: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, exactly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNora Ali: \u003c/strong\u003eCan you walk us through some of the math that goes into breaking even after you've experienced a setback?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTaylor Sohns: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah. So let's start mid-extreme right. So 2008, the market had pulled back the S\u0026amp;P 500 year had pulled back 49% at the depth of the drawdown. And not coincidentally, by any stretch of the imagination, when it pulled back 49%, you also had the highest level of selling that the s\u0026amp;p 500 has ever experienced. And so that's human nature, right? So human nature is Darwinian, whatever you want to call it, is fight or flight; we can't fight the stock market. So it's flight. So when people get scared, they say, I'm out. Right? And actually, when you look at consumer confidence, and I'm getting away from your question, I will get back to in a second, when you, when you look at consumer confidence, which right now is that the depth, which has a ton of pessimism, consumer confidence is actually an inverse indicator, when consumer confidence is really high, the subsequent 12 month period average, is a 4% return, when consumer confidence is really low, which is right now, the next 12 months average is a 25% return. So there have been eight points since consumer confidence has been tracked that have been as low as we're at right now; the average next 12-month return is 25%. With the worst performance over that 12-month period, being 14% return, I think any one of us raise our hand, say I'll take 40%. But again, going back to the original part of the conversation, you don't want to lose money. So when you look at 2008, the stock market pulled back 49%. We'll call it 50%. To round to get back to even when you lose 50%. It's not 50%. So let's do the math allowed here; you have $10 a start, it draws down to $5, a 50% loss, you need to double that 100% return to get back to $10. So the key to growing wealth over time is not hitting home runs because home runs come around with strikeouts as well. And that's losing money. The key to making money over time is consistently hitting singles and doubles. You can't afford that big drawdown. Because even if you are willing to sit in the seat through that big drawdown, and be down 50% and say, hey, I'll stick with it, you got to get 100% back to get you back to that breakeven mark. Whereas let's look at a different number. If you draw down 10% Well, that's not good either. But a 10% return, you need an 11% Return to get back to breakeven. So again, the bigger the drawdown, the bigger multiplier effect it is to get you back to even so again; at the end of the day, when it comes to investing, you win by not losing over time. And when you win by not losing, that comes back to that portfolio composition. You can't have all your eggs in one basket; you need to be diversified. So your overall portfolio isn't selling off at the same time, like an allocation sided with VTI.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNora Ali: \u003c/strong\u003eVery helpful context to close us out, Taylor. Can you walk us through some other goals-based investing strategies for our audience and examples you can share that have helped investors stay focused versus saying, oh, I just want to have X number of dollars in the future?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTaylor Sohns: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's really tough. If you asked most people, you know, XYZ, Mr. Mrs. Smith, that are together that are 30 years old. You just got married, and you put your money together in an account; how much money do you have set aside for your impending house purchase? Whatever it is, and they look at their account, and they go, Well, I see I have $25,000 in cash in our bank account. But we also need a car, and we're going to get a dog, and whatever it is, you don't have that money earmarked. Right. And that's something that's really important for you to do. So there are a couple of different ways that you can do this. You can set money aside in different bank accounts, which is a hassle, but that's also what some people do to say, hey, this money is specifically in this account because this is my car payment. And this money is in this account because this is my, you know, impending home down payment dollars. And that's exactly what we did. We launched our life go home downpayment product. We said, Hey, we know that people put their money not only in a checking account but also into a brokerage account like publix.com, and they have holdings there, and again if it's just four different ETFs that have different ticker symbols VTI, I keep picking on them for whatever reason, or is any of that money earmarked for something specific? No. So one of the reasons that we named our one ETF the home downpayment with a ticker $HOM is the psychological component to it. Someone looks at it and immediately goes, hmm, okay, I have $16,000 there. That's exactly how much money I have set aside for that home downpayment that is coming up when we find that right house over time, and along the way, that's invested conservatively to help you attempt to grind out returns to allow that 16,000 to come 16,005 on earn 17,000. And that's the intention of the product over time is to be that conservative, slow-mo, type portfolio that gets you to your goal over time. But again, to your point, the fact is that it's very hard if your money is just piled together to dictate what is meant for this purpose in this person, this purpose, and this one and that's a lot of the naming convention that went along with our home downpayment product, to begin with.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNora Ali: \u003c/strong\u003eAwesome, a lot of great insight today.

Welcome to Alts, the show on Public all about alternative investing and emerging trends happening at the intersection of culture and investing. I'm your host, Calum Johnson from the Alts team. Before we get into it, let's get the energy in the room up. Let's hit that like button. We've got a really exciting episode for you guys with some great guests. So let's get into that.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday we are joined by Dylan and Bradley from Altan insights, the leading platform for alternative asset investing, intelligence and analysis. Dylan and Bradley will be sharing some of the biggest findings from their latest research on the sports collectibles market covering both sports cards and memorabilia. Since we're going to be talking about so many current events and what's happening in these markets, at the moment through the report, and there's a lot to get through, we're going to skip the five and five and jump directly into it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo without further ado, let me hand it over to the guests. Dylan, Bradley, could you quickly reintroduce yourself to the audience? I know you've come on Public live a few times. Introduce yourself and Altan insights. Give us a bit of an overview of the new report that you've just released about sports collectibles in general.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eGreat. Thanks, Calum and thanks for having us back. My name is Dylan Dittrich, and I kind of lead the research effort at Altan Insights. And what Altan really focuses on is kind of empowering and arming the modern investor to explore alternative asset classes. Specifically, we look at collectible asset classes, things like fine art, wine, sports collectibles, classic cars. And so providing research analysis and data to kind of dig deeper into those asset classes, understand how they perform and understand the different kinds of forces that drive them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so as part of that effort on a quarterly basis, we put out a report on the state of the sports collectibles market, how sports cards are performing, how sports memorabilia is performing, you know, what are the different trends in different sports? How are collectors and investors approaching these categories? So I certainly would encourage everybody to visit the site and download the report if you're interested and have the time - but it was certainly an interesting second quarter to chronicle. Much like other assets that can be more speculative in nature, sports collectibles were challenged in some pockets, but had some really kind of interesting and even encouraging things happening in others. So looking forward to kind of diving into those with you guys today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd I'll just second Dylan. Thank you for having me on. I'm with Altan Insights as well. I do research alongside Dylan. I worked on the sports collectibles report that we put out recently in the first and second quarters as well as our art report and I’m also a qualified appraiser with the International Society of appraisers covering art, collectibles and memorabilia. So I've always had a big interest in the valuations of these assets, following them as actual investable vehicles and just tracking the data and the performance records everything that you can see in our reports on a quarterly basis, and you know, just putting out the research that we do looking at the sales and kind of going beyond just the numbers, so thank you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, great. Thank you both for the introduction. I want to get straight into the report. So like, what have we learned about the sports collectibles market in Q2? And I want to take kind of one of the big points that you made in that report, which was, are we seeing a healthy reset of the market away from speculation, or has a paradigm shift occurred that will change the way these markets perform going forward?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so I think just to zoom out a little bit, like some other categories of when, when the pandemic hit, kind of fueled by nostalgia fueled by stimulus checks, fueled by more time at home, sports collectibles really started to soar. So sports cards in particular, as people kind of, you know, revisited old treasures that might have been in the basement or the attic, and kind of revisited hobbies from their past. And it just brought a huge new audience into this space. And with that new demand came, you know, very rapid appreciation in these categories. And, as was the case, in other categories that saw similarly heightened demand over the last few years, the second quarter of 2022, was was challenging, as people became kind of skittish about the state of the economy, skittish about, you know, traditional financial markets, they were relatively eager and willing to sell these assets. And in many cases, that led to, you know, significant kind of declines in value across many different categories within the sports collectible space. And so I think a part of that is, is very likely a healthy reset of perhaps some things that had run a little bit too high, too fast.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut I think it's also important to add the caveat that, you know, it seems kind of indisputable that since before the last few years, the audience has definitely grown for the long term. And so, you know, we'd still expect to see there, you know, be more interested in this space than there was previously. But you know, when there's economic economic turmoil, when there's traditional financial market turmoil, it's not uncommon to see speculative assets like these sell off, even though that hasn't necessarily always been the case in sports collectibles. You know, historically, in other moments of financial crisis, economic crisis 2008, 2009, for example, you know, there are indices that suggest that sports cards didn't sell off that much. But, you know, we live in a very different kind of market today where people can basically sell cards that at a moment's notice, you know, friction is much lower than it has been in the past. And so when kind of investor and collector sentiment turns, you know, people can act on that, and so very easily nowadays and, and I think that played a role in sending some valuations lower in q2.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eBradley, did you want to jump in?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley: \u003c/strong\u003eI second Dylan on that. And also say that while we saw those pullbacks within the broader market, and I'm sure we'll touch on the upper end of the market, it continued to hold up well, which is something we haven't seen tested over the last few years, right. These are markets that have been tracked in some cases for decades now, and to see the broader market pull back rather significantly, and in some cases, well beyond even just a traditional stock market or other asset classes, but then to also simultaneously see the highest end of the card market your your blue chip type cards and memorabilia, seeing record prices, and in some cases, the auctions seeing heightened volume, more bidders, an increase in bids on high end cards definitely showed just a shift almost, when you look at a traditional market, that movement from maybe growth to value that you see sometimes in downturns. So it's certainly some things that we see across other markets are being replicated in sports collectibles as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, awesome. And just as a point for both of you, definitely feel free to just jump in whenever you want. We want to be as much of a conversation as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think you both made some great points. Dylan, I wanted to pick up on one thing you mentioned, which is the sports card market today, there's a lot less friction when it comes to access to liquidity. Could you go a bit deeper into that like, versus what we've seen historically, what are some of the factors that have caused there to be a lot less friction in the market, it's a lot easier for people to, like exit their position. Is that auctions? Is that the fractional markets? What are some of those factors that have caused that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, I think when you think about all of this new demand that's come into the space, you know, with that comes investment dollars and the pursuit of innovation, to make things, you know, easier on that new demand to make it easier for them to transact. And so I think a lot of the leading platforms in the space, whether you're talking about auction houses, whether you're talking about marketplaces, the technology that they're using has advanced considerably. The marketing around auctions has increased considerably, the frequency of auctions has increased considerably. And there's also a lot of, you know, competition to be the venue where people are buying and selling sports collectibles, and so that has the power to lower costs as well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so, whereas, you know, in decades prior, somebody might move to sell a card, and they might have to wait, you know, a month or two for the next auction, or they had to, you know, create their own eBay listing and kind of wait for that to be completed, it's really a lot easier today and it takes a lot less kind of manual legwork. And there are many platforms, you know, kind of designed to make buying and selling these things akin to buying and selling stocks. And we see that with fractional platforms as well. And so there's definitely an increased focus on liquidity, which is great, that means you can convert your asset to cash in a shorter amount of time and with greater ease. But on the flip side of that, that means that, you know, a market and valuations and price levels can react a whole lot faster when people start getting a bit nervous.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, I think it's such an interesting point that like the reduction in friction, means that from a psychological point of view, investors in sports cards can now act a lot more similar to how, you know, investors in more traditional assets, like stocks can behave.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and I think, you know, to use an example from a more traditional asset class, you know, you know, the performance of asset classes, like private equity and private real estate, are always touted as being quite strong on a risk adjusted basis. But part of that is because the, you know, the valuations are kind of marked to market, aren’t updated with as greater frequency as public markets. And these, you know, private investment firms aren't buying and selling with as much frequency as actors and traditional public markets. So in a way that kind of smooths over those, those rough economic and financial patches, it's not to say that their performance isn't strong, but there's there is kind of an element of the way that it's measured, you know, kind of making things look a little bit stronger on paper sometimes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, that's a really interesting point. I want to get a bit deeper into the data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd Bradley, maybe we can check to you for this one. I know one of the things that you mentioned in the report, was that you use the PWCC indices to kind of understand the market and what's happening. Can you quickly just explain to our audience, first of all, why is the PWCC indices so important for that? And then also, what are some of the limitations of using those indexes to look at the market today?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, definitely. So PWCC they’re a marketplace and auction house and they have multiple indices, they have five ranging from the PWCC, 100 500, and then 2500. And their indices track a range of cards, but they are primarily vintage based. So you mentioned, like some of the shortfalls of those indices, one of them is that they do primarily track vintage cards, so cards dating really pre 1980s. And so PWCC, they really have the longest tenure as a performance tracking metric, they date back to the early…actually to 2008 is when the PWCC indices start. So you kind of get that tail and in the 2009 timeframe of the financial crisis. So you have one of the reasons why I believe that they're used so frequently is not only because they date back, but more importantly, because they date back to a very specific moment in financial markets history. And they, if you look at the indices, they do change in terms of their composition, but they primarily revolve around your blue chip Mickey Mantle, Willie Mays, Jackie Robinson, Babe Ruth cards, whether they're rookies or just pre-war, or close to post-war cards, and those cards while they've performed very well, it's not always the greatest representation of the overall market. As I had discussed previously about how the broader market struggled but the blue chip higher end market performed very well, we just saw that happen.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo if you're looking at, you know, the last six to nine months, you might see a lot of cards across the board. And a lot of cars, maybe people on here owned, have maybe dropped in value. But meanwhile, we're seeing some record sales for Honus Wagner or Mickey Mantle or Babe Ruth, or whoever that player might be in their rookie cards or in some of their early cards, that maybe is not the greatest representation of the overall market. So that's the one challenge, it is used just because we need some way of tracking an industry that has a composition of multiple cards across a span of time. But as with any industry, it might not be the best representation of the overall market and also of the sale frequency. So it's not necessarily looking at in a downturn market, is the volume still the same? Are people still selling their cards in that period of time? Are people still buying those cards in that period of time? Is the market still as active? There's a lot of metrics that maybe aren't incorporated in some of those indices, which do create the shortfalls, but are still important to include in any research and analysis.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eI think it's such an interesting distinction, definitely when I started to learn more about sports cards, the distinction between like the vintage older cards, and then the more modern sports card, and perhaps you can both touch on this. Why do vintage markets perform so differently than like, more modern sports cards? Is it purely just about scarcity and supply? Or are there other factors that we can look at?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so this is, this was definitely one of the more interesting kind of tidbits to come out of our Q2 analysis. If you looked at second quarter performance of vintage and prewar cards, they were effectively flat down very, very slightly 1 to 2% versus modern and ultra modern cards, which were down in the neighborhood of 15 to 20%. And I think part of that is, you know, modern and ultra modern tend to be a bit more speculative in nature, you have speculation on players that are currently active younger players, people who have more of their career left in some areas, particularly in the ultra modern space.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd when you look at vintage, there's a very long tenured collector base, the scarcity is naturally very low, just just by nature of the fact that these cards have been around for decades and decades. You know, over time, some have been lost, they've been damaged, so supply is very low. And I think, you know, many collectors aren't turning these cards over with as great a frequency - they're holding on to them. And that means less supplies available to the market, which of course can help keep, you know, prices kind of higher as demand grows, or even stays the same. And that's where you find a lot of quote unquote, blue chip cards that are very, very popular historically that are very well known, that are kind of like the top pieces of almost akin to fine art in this category. So a bit less speculation, less supply, and more longer tenured collectors and holders of these assets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, and then just to add, there's also been so many market shifts across you know, when these cards were initially coming out, think about some of the cards maybe you've seen breaking records like a T 206 Honus Wagner like these were really advertisements. They weren't built for card collectors. They weren't being produced in mass for you know..they were being produced and then slid into a pack of gum or candy or cigarettes, or they were being stuck at tables at diners. They weren't being produced where then we saw that shift in the 70s, 80s, 90s, where then it rotated into what is known as the junk wax era where you had producers of cards, pumping out incredibly high quantities of cards. There's a ton out on the market, you don't really see a whole lot of 1990s players with high, high sales in their cards and today, the shift has really turned to grading where we’re seeing such an increase in cards being graded. People are sending them off to places like Beckett, PSA, SGC to be graded and a very high percentage of cards within populations are being graded. So it's just been a real overall shift in the market that has definitely aided I think vintage as standing out and standing alone from a period of time where people weren't collecting cards maybe for investment pieces.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson:\u003c/strong\u003e Bradley can you kind of go –I think that's a really interesting point you brought up on the grading, right? Can you kind of go a bit deeper? What is the impact on the market overall of you know, you're getting more PSA 10s You're getting more BGS 9.5 or whatever, like, what is the impact on vintage versus modern?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, definitely. It’s an impact that I don't think is probably being discussed enough. We do cover it quite a bit. We have a partnership with a company called Gem Rate, who tracks the percentage and the number of cards graded by companies like I mentioned previously, PSA, Beckett,STC. And for example, just PSA alone, they're seeing record cards coming through and being graded in items altogether. You know, their Q2 numbers, and this past quarter were the highest they've ever had graded. I believe the past month was their highest month on record. So at this point, you know, they've had two months this year, believe it was March, and then now July that have been their two highest grading totals in company history, in terms of just number of items.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd that impacts everything because a lot of these prices, especially in modern cards are dictated by the grade. So for example, PSA grades on a numeric scale one to 10. With as well as an authentic grade if the card is maybe in too poor of quality, to receive a number. But a PSA 10, which would be like a gem mint card, the highest tier, will historically sell for higher than a PSA nine of that same card, right? There may be a flaw in the nine that deducts that one point. The problem is that people today are pulling cards out of packs and sending them immediately to PSA, the card has a higher chance than receiving a 10. And in turn, that overall population is skyrocketing, right? We're seeing some players like in the NBA, Zion Williamson, John Moran, where they have super high numbers of - I mean talking 10s of 1000s of PSA 10 graded cards for some of their base cards right now. Where for example, with the vintage, you have to almost get to the 60s before you start seeing a lot of these cards, receiving tents and that just comes down to people weren't pulling them and sending them out\u0026nbsp;immediately from packs. So it definitely is having an impact. And I think long term, we're going to see a swell of cards that were graded, that received 10s. It's going to be very difficult to really ever find appreciation and an increase in value when you have a card that has 20,000+ grades, and then maybe 10 to 15% of that population is a PSA 10.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd if you think about it, Calum, if you're an owner of a great advantage card, the threat of the population have that card growing now and really making your card a lot less valuable just by nature of the supply growing is a lot lower relative to modern because you know these cards have been in circulation they've been unwrapped from packs decades ago, you know, every now and then yes, some some new population will find its way to the to the grading companies. But you know, the likelihood of that happening at scale is much lower than it is for modern and ultra modern cars, and that's why the kind of the risk return formula, so to speak, for vintage is a lot different than it is for modern and ultra modern cards.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, I think that's super interesting. I'm going to ask one more question on the card point before we shift over to game one memorabilia and memorabilia overall, which I know is a very different picture than the card market.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think one thing that was interesting as I was going through the report is amongst all kind of the doom and gloom in the sports card market, there were some promising signs. The economist David RPA, modern hockey card record sale at Heritage last month, the upcoming heritage auction for the Mantle. Can you both just kind of comment on those two sales and what you think they might indicate about the market overall as we look forward?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich:\u003c/strong\u003e I mean the Mantle sale - so for context, one of the very highest graded 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle cards is up for auction at Heritage auction later this month, the special card because basically what happened was, these cards weren't wildly popular. When they were released back in 1952. They sat on shelves, and it was time for basically the 1953 print run to start being sold and tops needed the warehouse space. So they basically dumped boxes, and boxes and boxes of these cards into the ocean. And Mickey Mantle is kind of one of the preeminent, you know, baseball, cultural icons, certainly baseball card icons. And so probably one of the four very best examples of this card is being auctioned later this month. It's already over $7 million at auction, there's, I think, a pretty strong expectation that it's going to end up at $10 million plus.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe last time there was a sale of..so that's an SGC 9.5 Mickey Mantle. Back in early 2021, there was a sale of a PSA nine mantle for $5.2 million. And, you know, the stats are pretty clear that afterwards, not only did the broader and kind of lower quality Mantle market absolutely soar higher, but you could make the argument that, you know, it led to, you know, significant appreciation in the broader card market as well. It's a really big deal when a sale that big makes a very wide range of mainstream news headlines, because that creates new demand. It gets people excited about the space again, and it tends to have pretty wide ranging impacts. Now granted, it does take a sale of $5 million or $10 million to generate that excitement, which is exceedingly rare, but it does happen and it'll be really interesting to see, you know, what happens in the wake of that sale next month, or later this month rather.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd all along the Mantle card has always stood out from a baseball standpoint, similar to in hockey. We've had a seven figure sale of Wayne Gretzky, but we have also been tracking as you mentioned, the McDavid card. So modern hockey has similar to some of the other modern sports has lagged pretty significantly in terms of the overall market. So in the first quarter, golden oxygens sold a Sidney Crosby card. It was a gold precious metal gems and went for 100 in just under $165,000, which set a record for any modern hockey card. And then in this past quarter or the past quarter we've just had or past month, there was a 2015 Connor McDavid card, which is an autographed patch card. So it has a patch from a game worn jersey within it, and it's sold for $228,000. So that established a new modern hockey card price.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd actually, this is very timely, because just this week, there was one of the other so there are three cards in the population for the Connor McDavid that are graded PSA 10, and another one just sold this week for just over $200,000. So heading into the second quarter, we had never had a sale for a modern hockey card go for more than $200,000 and now we've had one, you know, essentially in the past 30 days now we've had two cards, same card, same grade, but it was definitely a validating sale to see one sell via eBay for over $200,000. So definitely some momentum within that market. But again, it's really a couple names: Connor McDavid, Sidney Crosby, Alexander Ovechkin. But beyond those three, hockey though, just continues to trail the field overall for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, very interesting. I'm conscious that we're nearly at time. Everyone can stay on if they're interested to hear more, because we're gonna go into the sports memorabilia market. And I think if Q1 was kind of, you know, there was a plunging in the sports card market. I think it was the exact reverse on the sports memorabilia side.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCould you, and I'll put this to both of you. Can you kind of just give us some context, data wise what we saw with sports memorabilia, and then also like, what is the significance like why did this happen?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so on kind of the second part of that question first. So when the sports card market was was booming, you'd see, and Bradley just alluded to one of them, you would see these cards that have little patches from either a game worn or player player worn jersey, selling for, you know, hundreds of 1000s of dollars, which in many cases is more than a full game used jersey would actually sell for. And so I think for the last few years, people both outside of the space, especially but also inside the space, have kind of taken a step back and said like, that doesn't make any sense. Like why is this little patch that's, you know, encased in cardboard selling for more than an entire game use jersey. And I think, you know, the idea that that shouldn't necessarily be the case has started to take hold, and the second quarter we saw, really for the entirety of 2022, but really in the second quarter we saw game worn jersey sales make headlines, there was a Diego Maradona, game worn jersey from the famous Hand of God World Cup match sold for over $9 million. Sotheby’s Golden Age auctions sold a set of Tiger Woods clubs from when he won the tiger slam for over $5 million.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so we just saw a huge volume of sales that were kind of headline sales that were over six figures. So to put it in context, in the second quarter of 2022. There were 42 sales at auctions of game used memorabilia that crossed $100,000. A year ago in the second quarter, there were just 13. So you're talking about more than triple, you know, increase. And I think a lot of that is, you know, card collectors coming into this space and realizing that there's, you know, an opportunity to own some incredible artifacts that, you know, maybe stand out from kind of the traditional to their traditional kind of cardboard pursuits.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, we put out actually a thread today on Twitter, Altan Insights, where we covered some of these record breaking sales and sports memorabilia. And one of the big highlights is, you know, the record books have really been reconstructed this year. There's three of the five largest public sales ever that have occurred. In terms of sports memorabilia, just this year alone. Dylan mentioned the Maradonna and then also the Tiger Woods. Also the Muhammad Ali championship belt that's sold. So we're just seeing the shift of people going after these really high end really impressive items that have historic context around them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo it's really exciting to see this shift in this movement of money that's going after you look at even at the Heritage auction coming up that we mentioned, there's the Mickey Mantle card, and that's going to be the big headline grabber. But very likely we'll see a new record set for a baseball bat. There's a 1918,1920 circa Babe Ruth game used in sign that that right now is priced just under a million dollars. I wouldn't be surprised if it by the end of the auction is a multi million dollar bat. It's a really impressive piece that is one of the earliest bats on the market that we've ever seen. I know there's been a lot of collectors out there looking for Babe Ruth's first bat that he used. So that had hit the market back in the early 2000s and went for over a million dollars. It hasn't came back yet. But this bat is probably about the second best thing that we've ever seen.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd the momentum is just continuing within the space. And also just announced yesterday, I believe Sotheby's is going to be selling a Michael Jordan jersey from the 1998 NBA Finals. And that jersey will likely establish not only a new record for any Michael Jordan, game use jersey, but actually any basketball jerseys. We would need to get up to about 4 million to do that. It has an estimate between 3 to 5 million, but with the momentum we're seeing in the prices for other athletes like Ali marathon Tiger Woods, probably seems fitting that Michael Jordan would fit in somewhere in that as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eNow that's pretty iconic. You know, one thing I wanted to follow up on when we talk about these really high sale prices, especially with sports memorabilia. I know one thing that comes into it is the photo matching element. Could you guys just speak briefly about - refresh the audience on what is photo matching, first of all? And then why has it become so important in the valuation of these assets?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, photo matching has become a critically important topic. I think it always, not always, but it has been important over the last few years, but its importance has only increased as you see these very high value auction items being sold, and therefore the stakes being raised. And essentially, for those that don't know, you know, if you talk about something like a Michael Jordan worn jersey, or you know, a Wayne Gretzky worn jersey from the Stanley Cup, you want to know, if you're paying millions of dollars for this item? How do I know that he wore it in this game.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so what photo matching is to kind of simplify it is basically comparing the game worn Jersey in question to very high resolution photos taken during the game in question, to match up very kind of, in most cases, minute details to confirm that this is indeed the jersey that was worn by that player in that game. And it can be things as small as you know, different holes in the mesh different, you know, little pieces of stitching, and how they appear on the jersey and, and matching those elements to the Jersey that's being sold.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd you know, I think when these very large prices are being paid, authentication is so very critical for the credibility of the market, for the credibility of those selling the item. And then for the buying collector to you know, be reassured that the item they've spent money on was who was really as built. And so photo matching is one way that that's accomplished. And you're kind of hard pressed to see nowadays, items sell for very high values without being photo matched to, you know, a certain moment. Generally not the case for more vintage items, for obvious reasons that the high resolution photography that you need to really make a conclusive photo match wasn't available until really, really more recently, but definitely important for any kind of more modern piece of game worn material.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd to follow up, we dove into some of the data behind that photo matching and just looking at so in Q2, out of the top 10 sales, eight of them were marketed as being photo matched. And so there's a few companies out there Resolution, My Gray, who photo match these items, and 18 of the top point five items sold memorabilia wise at auction in the second quarter, add some label or some nod to photo matching, and that compares to 60% of the top 10, the previous year, 12 out of the top 25. So a pretty big difference. It's been around as Dylan had mentioned, but at this point, especially as we start to see these modern assets and the memorabilia side, continue to develop in price, it's pretty much necessary outside of a certificate or a letter of authenticity from the league, or the player itself. You know, memorabilia has always been a little bit of a money market because a lot of these assets weren't supposed to ever make it to an auction house, right?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, the Tiger Woods clubs that Golden Age sold, there was a little dispute because Tiger Woods and his agent claimed to still have the clubs, because there's almost this idea that they're not supposed to ever leave the player and it's somebody's responsibility to grab that jersey after the game and keep it, or to secure the club so they never see an auction house. But it was the work of some experts in the space that looked at a bunch of attributes around the clubs between the grip to ball marks to photos, and then were able to provide an opinion a photo match that pretty clearly had an impact considering they sold for over $5 million and easily exceeded any previous golf clubs sold by about $5 million. So it's having an impact on these markets, no question about it. And I really think in the next few years, it's going to become...if it's anything that is photo-matchable so it's not vintage, but it's anything really 1970 on it's going to require some sort of photo matching being a given for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eIt's really interesting, and to be honest, it's pretty incredible that some of these assets they can even match it using photographs and all these things. Before we close out, I wanted to talk about the Muhammad Ali belt. Huge sale, there $6.18 million. I think the initial estimate was to be around like a million dollars.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan you talk about what was the level of photo matching that we saw there? What was some of the story behind that? Like, why did it exceed the estimate by such a large degree?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eSo this is actually one of those interesting and rare cases where there actually wasn't a photo match at hand. And really, what the kind of source of you know, credibility and authenticity here was the provenance so meaning what was kind of the line of ownership from, you know, when the belt was on Muhammad Ali to when it came to auction. So a little bit of background, I think it was last month, heritage sold the WBC Heavyweight Championship belt that Muhammad Ali earned for his win in the Rumble in the Jungle, and they sold it for just under $6.2 million.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis one came from the collection of Drew Bandini Brown, who was Ali's corner man. He kept a lot of artifacts, memorabilia from all of his career in a storage unit. Eventually, the contents of that storage unit were sold. But it's a case where you know you have pretty strong provenance. You know where that belt’s been, you feel fairly confident that this is a belt that was earned by Ali - it was worn by Ali.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd it really led to a bidding war between two bidders who were seemingly unwilling to lose. Turns out the winner was Colts owner Jim Irsay, who has basically been building a museum quality collection of kind of American cultural artifacts that he's actually taken on tour. So it's like, it's one of my favorite kind of investing rules for you know, really blue chip alternative collectibles is like, would Jim Irsay buy this because time and time again, he invariably shows up as a winner of a lot of these auctions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut yeah, one of those rare cases where, you know, photo matching wasn't playing a significant role in the authenticity here. But sometimes at an auction, all it takes is two highly motivated bidders to drive a value to, you know, levels that people previously thought were unheard of. Especially interesting in this case, because there is another WBC Heavyweight Championship belt that actually trades fractionally. And, you know, now that the question becomes, you know, what's that one worth? So definitely an interesting, very interesting piece of memorabilia. Very interesting story, and, you know, another just massive result.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBradley Calleja: \u003c/strong\u003eJust as a follow up, I actually spoke this week with a representative from Heritage who runs some of their consignment, and was talking to him at one point about that night when it's sold, and it was out of the blue for them. So we talked about where something like that comes from, he had actually gone to sleep, said he woke up at like 3am and stuff was like still going. And to see, you know, they, you know, some people that are going to be involved in the auction, for example, they set a million dollar estimate, they had word of mouth from some potential betters that those bidders weren't going to let it go for under a million. But that's all it takes is two bidders on some of these items.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd the same could go for this Mantle card coming up at the end of the month, or the Jordan jersey in September that I mentioned previously, like, it just comes down to if you have some people who are willing to put out that kind of money. And now we're at a point where that table and that tier has been set, where now it used to be a million dollars was a big hurdle for an auction house to clear. If they could clear that million dollar, you know, everyone was clapping and it was a really respectable auction. And that meant that they had a really strong line of bidders where it's almost 5 million at this point where, you know, it's like you're expected to have bidders lined up that are willing to push these items higher and higher the levels that we just haven't seen up until this year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, it's pretty incredible to be honest, when you look at some of the other asset markets for crypto, for stocks, and you see how bearish people are and kind of the the sentiment there that we still have some of these really high ticket sales and records being broken in some of the alternative asset markets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDylan and Bradley, It's been a pleasure to have you guys on the show again, you're always welcome. Thank you to the audience and everyone that listened.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDylan Dittrich: \u003c/strong\u003eThank you, Calum.

Welcome to Alts, the show on Public all about alternative investing and emerging trends happening at the intersection of culture trend investing. I'm your host Calum Johnson from the Alts team. Today, we are joined by Gerard Starkey, sports memorabilia expert, and co-founder of SAAS. Over the last 20 years, Gerard has built one of the most valuable and complete Michael Jordan player exclusive game worn collections in the world, and has been featured in Highsnobiety and elsewhere, as one of the preeminent MJ collectors. Sports memorabilia is a really exciting alts category, and he'll be demystifying it for us today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore we get to that, though, we're going to cover some of the biggest headlines happening in the world of alts in a section I like to call five and five, five headlines in five minutes. Let's get started. So first of all, Nike sold a virtual NFT sneaker designed by artists to Kashi American army for $134,000. The sneaker was one of 20,000 in Nike;s first release with artifact in April. Collectors are hoping the shoes will become part of games like fortnight and Grand Theft Auto Six, while others are interested in physical versions of the shoes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eeBay is launching its first ever NFT collection. Thirteen limited edition NFTs that feature 3D animations of hockey legend Wayne Gretzky making one of his signature moves. They plan to drop additional NFT collections throughout the year in partnership with web3 platform OneOf.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe world's largest bottle of whiskey was sold for $1.4 million by auction house, Lyon and Turnbull on May 25. The bottle stands at an incredible 5’11 and was given a Guinness world record for being the world's largest bottle of whiskey in September 2021. It contains enough to fill about 444 standard bottles, or enough to make 5,287 whiskey sours, which is pretty crazy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNew York based real estate, investment and brokerage firm Acada listed a New York building as an NFT on OpenSea for 15,000 ETH, approximately $27 million. The NFT represents ownership of the building. However, the buyer still has to follow standard real estate procedure offline for the transaction to go through.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, a former OpenSea employee has been indicted in the first ever case of NFT insider trading. Thirty-one year old former Product Manager Nathaniel Chastain was responsible for selecting which NFTS would be displayed on OpenSea’s homepage. He would then use that information to buy those NFTs before they were featured, and then flip them for 2-5x profits after that. So that's our five and five for today. We're now going to switch over to speaking with our guest Gerard Starkey. Gerard, welcome to the show. It's a pleasure to have you on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eThanks for having me on. It's a pleasure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, awesome. I'm super excited for this one. So just to begin, can you give us a backstory? I think you have like the most valuable MJ game on collection out there. Can you kind of just give us an intro into how you got into collecting these items?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eI think first just to correct slightly, at one point in time, I was definitely the most valuable Michael Jordan collector, but in the recent in recent years, some very, very large investors have come in and bought up, you know, millions of millions of dollars of items in a very short span of time. So I'm definitely up there in the top two or three guys, but I'm possibly not the most valuable at this stage. But I was at one point.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, you're in the conversation for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I'm definitely up there. But I don't want to claim the crown without giving my peers and fellow collectors, you know, the same type of esteem all the way up at the top there. For me it started before value was even a concern because for me it started out of pure passion as a teenager. And as you said earlier on, I've been collecting for about 25+ years. And I didn't necessarily start in Michael Jordan stuff. Specifically like stuff he'd actually used. It actually started just in the kind of the regular kind of original Jordans that were available at the time and and gradually progressed through the various kind of categories of collecting whether it was like originals, hard to get rare samples, back to originals again, and then the original market.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOriginal releases of the Jordan shoes where it was very hot in late 90s, early 2000s, like it was, it just increased massively. And I actually was given a pair of game-worn Jordans from an ESPN athlete, I can go into that story at some point, but I was given them by an ESPN, so a cameraman, who was French. And when, as soon as I held that asset, the asset that I previously owned at the time, but that I previously collected didn't mean as much to me, because I had this asset that, you know, represented this athlete. And at that point, I took the opportunity to sell all my originals, which I sold very quickly. And I basically plugged it all into actual game news items. And now that was not as easy to find, but I'm quite resourceful. I speak seven or eight languages.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I basically went into the market on a global scale and just bought everything I could. And this went on for about 1015 years before the real boom happened, and I did it quite silently, because that was just my strategy, not quite being quite a competitive person. And being well, I was based in London, most of that time. So all of my peers were in Asia and the States. So for me to get stuff, I have to really hustle and bustle and just just grab as much as I could. And yeah, to this day, I don't sell my own collection, I just vault stuff and enjoy it and have it on display at my home and rotate it and collect things. I still obviously enjoy collecting. But you know, it's much harder now because the caliber of items I want to collect it's large sums of money. And I have to be quite selective, to be honest. Because I can't compete with all the bigger players in the current market. However, I obviously have a number of assets that these guys want. So the only way for me to really get into some of the really big, multimillion dollar items is to trade out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat's my collecting career in a nutshell and now I've built up so much expertise in the space that you know, I dibble and dabble in helping the Jordan Brand, do marketing campaigns. I am an adviser to big collectors around the world, helping them build up their collections. I do storytelling in displays around the world with various clients and partners. And I've got my own authentication company SAAS where, just like Public's doing, my main goal is to educate so that people can understand the assets, appreciate the assets, and get a really good sense of the value of the assets, because I think that's quite important. I think that is going to be the key element of this particular space, and actually any collecting space is going to focus on in the next sort of three to five years. It's all going to be about really getting specific, really getting clear valuations of stocks. At the moment, I think things are still bouncing around. But we'll get into that as we go through the question. So that's me and my collection, career from start to end and looking forward.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, sweet as you were saying that I was like, Gerard is living the dream, like the dream of any NBA fan, Michael Jordan fan. He is living it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI wanted to ask you because I think this is really interesting, and also just to give people in the audience a bit more context. Can you talk us through some of like those highlight pieces, those assets that are currently in your collection? Maybe like two or three of your favorite ones? And then also take us through like, how did you even get it? Maybe you can give us like a quick story of an interesting acquisition story.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, I think probably the asset that I own, the pair of shoes I own that people will most likely recognize, is that I own The Shot. So I own the Black Cement Jordan 4s that Michael Jordan wore when he hit the shot over Craig Ehlo of the Cavs. And that for me is definitely in terms of emotional value an asset that captures a really big turning point not just in Michael Jordan's career but in the whole basketball, NBA kind of history. It's, in my opinion, its top three, possibly top one or two moments ever. So that's definitely, in my opinion, the biggest asset that people will really appreciate, I think on a global scale without question.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI own obscure pieces like the Nike Alpha Force that Michael Jordan wore in the same kind of period, as he was wearing Jordan, threes and fours and he was trying to, you know, get comfortable in the shoes. There's some talk about him, it being a transition point, as am I going to stick with Jordan, they're trying different midsole shoes models, and he actually started wearing Nike Alpha force, which isn't the Jordan shoe. But he wore them two or three times, and I have the pair that he played in against the Milwaukee Bucks. So that's a cool, very unique piece, not as big a celebrity as The Shot. But definitely for me, it's a piece that I appreciate a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then you're seeing other other shoes that I would love to have in my collection that have eluded me. I mean, the obvious one, for me is the last shot, which is Michael Jordan's final pair of shoes, which, I mean, I've literally searched for, I mean, I'm a resourceful man. And I've searched for it far and wide. And I mean, there's two pairs out there. And one of them potentially, is that model. But there's also a possibility that Michael Jordan has kept that one himself, which would make sense to me. But it's just not a pair that I've ever been able to acquire. But that would be monumental. And I mean, the closest pair I've seen to that very last pair is actually up at Christie's actually, it's an auction I've held here, the shameless plug, but there is an amazing, low 13 game-worn Michael Jordan sample that's actually on the market as we speak. And that's pretty much as close as I think any of us will get to that last shot ever. And that's, that's an amazing piece.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eWhen you even think to yourself,\u0026nbsp;“I would love to own the last shot piece” or “ the last shot sneaker,” how does that process of even trying to track it down start? Is it all just personal connections? What's that research process?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's, I mean, my process is I mean, everybody knows I'm an actuary by profession. So my mind is quite analytical, I love a good spreadsheet. I love a good list. So over the years, I've basically built databases of you know, where these assets are, whether it's jerseys, shoes, bats, helmets, you know, not necessarily specific to Michael Jordan, but where big assets are, who owns them, you know, their numbers, their emails, some photos of those assets, the tagging just so I can keep myself fully educated as to you know, the authenticity and what I should be looking for.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI do actually have big personal databases that you know, are super valuable to me and help me try to track these things down. And once you get into the circle you know, you do meet insiders, insiders to these athletes, these these these gods so to say, of the world and you can navigate through, there is a there's a way to navigate through that community and figure out how to get out get out assets once you do a deal. Whenever I do deals in the past, it was never you were never buying one item. It wasn't efficient, you were potentially having to get on a plane and travel to Hong Kong or New York and as I said I was based in London in Europe most of the time. So if I was going in, I was going for the kill and I was going to buy as much as I could, you know? And when you get known to be a reliable person who does deals who buys stuff off the medics, the teammates, the ball boys, you know, use that they pass your lap around respectfully and they and you can you know pay the right money for the assets. And at the time it was much simpler like I said they were trying to get rid of assets anonymously without you going to the market. You know, there wasn't really a deep liquid market for them at that point. They also didn't want to be known to be selling the asset that Michael Jordan gave them, so it was much easier. But that's how I go about it and I apply the same technique. Circle still exists, you know, there are other layers, there are more auction houses, there are more dealers, there are more middlemen, but it's just navigating the space. Like any space just like buying a house or a property, it's very similar actually.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eOkay, awesome. I want to zoom out a little bit. I know, there's probably a lot of people in the audience who are interested in potentially investing in sports memorabilia, and just learning more about the market in general, could you kind of just quickly define for us, what exactly is the sports memorabilia market, and then what makes this category special?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, sports memorabilia market as an asset, if I was thinking about in a real simple kind of definition, any asset that captures an athlete, either his image or a moment, or an event in sports history. And this can be purely a photo on a card, or an actual item used at that point in time or something with a signature from that era. It's a very broad category, so it captures the essence of an athlete.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s an interesting category because, I mean, for me, first, take one quick step back to make it clear what the following statement means, to me, it's like an art. These are moments that people have created at the very peak of their career. And if anybody on the call has ever, you know, going down that route of being an athlete or doing a sport, you know, it is extremely difficult to work your way up that ladder to become the top person, just like any artists would have had to work, you know, hundreds of 1000s of hours, you know, to be known as the, you know, the Michelangelo or the Picassos of the world, you know, these athletes have created these moments by being that great. So for me, they aren't just rubber and canvas and suede and leather, and you know, and wood and whatever, whatever materials they use in the equipment. They're actual moments in time that represent something very deep, very hard to achieve, and hence, they are pieces of art, which you which become talking points become storytelling points. And that's how I treat it. So to me, it's art. It's the emotional value. It's the moment, it's a historical moment in time that they capture that they represent, that gives them value.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I think to your point, the emotional value is so strong, so strong, right? Like we remember those moments that MJ last game shot and different moments. One thing I'm interested in from the investor perspective, is what are some of the factors, the value drivers, of a certain piece of sports memorabilia? I know you mentioned obviously, the moment, like what it's associated with, the athlete. Is there anything else? Can you kind of just elaborate on what some of those important factors are?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eI mean, those are extremely important facts that you raised. But I think rarity is key, like with any asset. And now the space is becoming much more liquid, and much more, much more educated, people really understand what rarity actually actually means. Now, for me, rarity is literally a handful, you know, and I know there are assets out there. I mean, there is an intersection between demand, and, and supply. And, you know, the perfect example for me is like the card market, the sports card market, there could be 200,000 people who want this one card, and there's only 700 of them, and that seems like a very high demand ratio. And I agree, but actually, ultimate or absolute rarity, where you can have something that like two or three or no other person has, that for me is the ultimate factor. And as we get more educated, we need to know how to filter down to what that rarity actually means. So, in cards, there's, you know, there are populations, there are I mean, you have to think of what is important in the card, what is the emotional value in a card in the card mark is my interpretation. So all the basic stuff about the quality of the card, the centering of the card, you know, the edges of the card, how perfect that card is preserved, those are all very easy parameters to understand. The hard bit is actually delving down to actual rarity and the authenticity and the you know, and the meaning meaningfulness of that card.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I think with cards, the excitement usually comes from, say, pulling a card. So being able to calculate and understand the probability of you actually pulling that card that is going to be a big factor in rarity. Which athlete it was related to, that's going to have a big big driver of value and rarity, you know, within each of those athletes, each of those athletes have one or two cards that are the cards to have actually, they probably will have one card is the card. And if it is\u0026nbsp;the card that is in your basic kind of starting point, this is the card I want for Gretzky or for Mantle or for MJ. And then you have to take that particular card and then filter that particular example down into the best version of that example.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith game used stuff, it's slightly more complex because once it's far more complex, because it's there's you know, authenticating a card is quite simple, because they are just pieces of paper that capture that nostalgia, authenticating and valuing game used jerseys and shoes is there a lot more intricate details to look at tags and where and you go down this angle of the photo matching, and we'll talk about a bit more about photo matching later on. But after photo matching and understanding signatures, it then gets into this kind of moment, space. And up to that photo matching kind of factor that you're considering, the prices on these things will be kept because it's you know, it's just photo matched. And it could be, you know, just a regular season game, but it's photo match, you know, he wore it. So it's great, it's a great asset, but the price will be capped. The moment it's photo matched, but also the moment that it's photo matched to a huge or significant or turning point, then the price will just shoot up. And that's because it's rarity, meaningfulness, emotional value, and, and that's what these assets, you know, that's why those assets then sort of transition from a sports card or sports item into a piece of art and a piece of history. And I think people are getting far more educated. I mean, there are a lot of sports thinkers, kind of like myself and there's lots of people in the market who\u0026nbsp;try to go out there and kind of give these parameters to people and give that kind of food for thought. So they can think about the value themselves. And it is complicated, but I do really feel that the market is getting very sophisticated. And buyers we're getting very sophisticated and very demanding. And that's right, I think, and I actually support that a lot because it gives us base credibility and value.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eYou know, one thing I think that's so interesting, as I was listening to you speak is that, and I think this is a great point also for our audience. As you know, they continue to learn more about alts. And I'm even on my own journey of learning more about alts. And I think every kind of alts category has its own nuances, you know, when it comes to evaluating an asset. So for instance, you gave the example of sports cards where like the grading and the condition of the card is like a huge determinant. There's different determinants when you look at things like the art market or comic book market. And then obviously, sports memorabilia. Could you just elaborate a bit more? You spoke about photo matching, can we start at the beginning? Like what is even photo matching? Can you kind of just explain that whole process, like what does it even mean?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eSo photo matching - this will apply to game used stuff firstly, so you photo match game used items. And what that effectively means is that using images and video for when the asset was actually used. You're effectively able to superimpose the asset you have in your hand on top of the image, and every single crease, loose thread game used blemish, production blemish lines up so that it is absolutely conclusive that the asset you have in your head is the exact asset used by Maradonna or by you know, MJ or by David Beckham. And there is zero doubt there. I mean, it's just conclusively matched and attributed to that particular moment. And then if that moment is a big moment, then that's the next stage of kind of research and value.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Actually, to be honest, and in my opinion, once you've got the photo matched assets, you get so far up the chain. It's the moment that really adds value. You know, and I think, and the uniqueness of that moment moment and, you know, factors that you that the asset has that relate to that moment, you know, for example, I mean, a perfect example of a photo matched asset is something that Public actually have within their portfolio is the Shattered Backboard, Air Jordan 1, which is I mean, I'm obviously biased, because, you know, I was I was involved in that particular transaction some years ago. But that asset has photos of Michael Jordan, taking off his shoes, and giving them to the other athlete. Now, that's just unheard of. And that particular nuance parameter is super important because it not only photo matches the asset to something that MJ would have worn in a big moment, but it also photo matches the backstory and the provenance. So there's, you've conclusively photo matched but also conclusively fact checked, and you have photographic evidence of the backstory and how it actually got from Michael Jordan's feet, to the open market.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd the fact that Michael Jordan was the person handing the asset over is so significant, because usually, it would go into the admin team or his charity team, or, you know, his, you know, there would be a process because he was such a huge, huge, huge athlete, and he was huge from from day one. I mean, people knew he was a big deal from day one. So to have an asset that comes direct from him, insane. And for me, personally, I mean, if I would have value, it's way up there. It's way up there. I mean, Maradonna’s hand of God, and you know, Kobe's rookie jerseys have absolutely nothing on that particular shoe. But it requires a level of understanding and appreciation of what it actually is, you know?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's so interesting. I'm kind of interested to talk and like, get your opinion on what's happening in the market currently. I know, if we look at the top of the market, we saw in 2021, there was the sale of the 1984, Michael Jordan Airships, which kind of set a record at Sotheby's for over $1.4 million. What have we seen happen from that point? I know you alluded to some other things like sports memorabilia sales, just then the hand of God and different things. What are we kind of seeing in the market right now?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah so what is happening here is that the buyers and investors in these particular assets are extremely educated and they know exactly what they need that asset to have for it to be effectively a one of one, or a really big momentous moment. So the hand of God whatever the 9.3 million for that jersey, it makes absolute sense because it doesn't matter what what you do in life or what your interest in life, you know Diego Maradonna is and we know about that moment, and it's not particularly you know, a positive you know, it is a moment that that has a lot of controversy attached to it. And that just makes it a great asset, which is why that value makes sense. And it shows you the capability of some of these assets. You know, the Kobe Bryant rookie jersey is the one that sold for 3.6 and one that sold for 2.6, 2.7 photo matched rookie moment, rookie Jersey, obviously the passing of Kobe has helped those jerseys as well, rest in peace. But it just shows you that people really know what they want, it has to have every single parameter. If you had a photo of I mean, the Hodges who got the jersey from Maradonna is obviously proof a very good provenance, but there's no photo of Diego Maradonna giving the jersey to him, but it's obviously that the exact jersey because it's photo matched, and it was a very easy photo match and a great photo match. But it was such a unique moment. It was easy, but had Diego Maradonna signed that jersey or if there was an image of him, not being able to really speak English and Hodges saying hey, pointing Give me your jersey if that was documented it would be even more valuable. Similar to the Kobe jerseys, if there were other attributes that made it more unique, and that made the story more clear, the value just goes up, you know.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think what's going on the market is people are really buying meaningful stuff. I mean, I can speak more. I think my knowledge is definitely more expert on the memorabilia side. And as a game used memorabilia side, and I think that's what's happening there. And in my view on the card market, is that people are getting more educated on what actual rarity is. And, you know, I think, game used, and cards, there's definitely a vintage, historic and kind of modern market. As always, with cards, I do just think, by default, the vintage market will always be more valuable. But obviously, as time surpasses, you know, the new market becomes vintage, and it will gradually grow. But there are giants in the sports world, and they've been the same giants for many, many years, even with, you know, Kobe Bryant is a good example. And I think, as I said, that's why I said his passing has added value to those particular jerseys.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the Michael Jordan, rookie jersey, you know, if there was a photo match one it would be significantly more valuable than that. And I think a lot of the collectors in the sports space would agree to that. I know Michael Jordan is still alive, but he's not going to create any more of those moments. I mean, I've seen, I've recently seen an amazing asset, which I can't wait until it comes to the market, but I've seen his playoff, his first playoff rookie shoes. And it's\u0026nbsp;a really great photo match. And if, you know, if a Kobe Jersey sells for $3.6 million, I can see when a shoe like that comes to market or just explode that particular value, because it's such an iconic shoe. And it's his very first playoff and it was used in like two or three of the game. So yeah, I think people want the big pieces, the big investment, the big pieces, this is helping the medium and lower side of the market. But I do think that side of the market will stabilize a bit more, and the value will be very clear to everybody. But yeah, so I think what's going on, I think education is going to be key in terms of estimating the values.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, awesome. Okay, cool. I'm going to ask you one more quick question, because I know that we're running over. And I think I think it's such a great point that you make about education. And it's great to hear that, like, as the market is maturing that people, you know, they're getting more educated, they're getting more knowledgeable about these assets. And it's such a great time for the public, for our audience to then kind of come into these categories as well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy final question for you was, you spoke about Maradonna, Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan. These are obviously like Pantheon all time, great athletes, right? When you look at the current kind of crop of athletes who are playing now, are there any that you look at and you think, once they're kind of game used, game worn memorabilia kind of gets out there in the future, it could rival in terms of the sale price? It could kind of rival what we've seen with like, the MJ assets or the Kobe assets or the marathoner assets. Are there any kind of athletes that you look at that will do that?,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGerard Starkey: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah I definitely think they have potential to get up there. This is the will in the basketball world. The Lukas and the Steph Currys, they will get up there. The one thing I will say for the modern athletes, basketball and other sports, is that their game-issued items are much more abundant. So they will be just a much larger supply that also applies to cards as well as a huge supply of modern cards. I do think they can get up there but they literally have to check every single box it would have to be highest scoring game, best playoff run you know you won't really have many multi game worn stuff because of the abundance of the jerseys and stuff for example, but yeah there are definitely are players that will get up there in basketball and football I'm trying to think. Well obviously the Nemars and Mbappes of the world will get up there because there's a direct link there to the Messies and the Ronaldos and the Van Bastens of the world.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut I think more of what would be the thing to look out for is the gods of the other sports where less focus is currently on at the moment. Those are the ones that will come up I think. I mean, I do honestly think basketball will always be Michael Jordan and then the Kobes and LeBrons and the other greats. Boxing will always be, you know, Mike Tyson. You know, the F1 Racing market will always be Schumacher. You know, Lewis Hamilton and Verstappen will be up there, you know, but everybody's going to want to go back to Schumacher. But I think with education and people understanding all the parameters that they're interested in and getting that real one of one meaningful moment, those will be the athletes we need to look out for that will just jump up there. So not necessarily specifically.. well, obviously, they have to be very good athletes in whatever sport they play, but it will be that one of one, this really unique story that makes them valuable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCalum Johnson: \u003c/strong\u003eSuper, super insightful.

Today we are going to be talking about Nintendo, more specifically the outlook for Nintendo as we move ahead into the rest of the year into some big launches for the company. We're going to get your perspective on what comes next for Nintendo. So if you're ready, we can kick right off.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Pachter:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e I'm ready.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAlright, sounds great. So Michael, can you give us a quick overview into Nintendo's business strategy, where it generates revenue, how it operates as a business. Tell me a little bit more about that 30,000 foot view. What is he big picture for Nintendo's business?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Pachter: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSure. They were founded in 1865, I think 1865 or 1869, I always get the year mixed up. And they were like a trading card company. And they kind of invented that in Japan, and you know, muddle along, made money and discovered video games in the 70s with arcade style games. So many people, I'm not sure very many of your viewers have actually ever played an arcade game in an arcade, but Donkey Kong was their first giant hit. And it was Mario running up a ramp and avoiding barrels being thrown by the gorilla who is Kong. So Donkey Kong was Mario trying to get past Kong, and get through all the levels and ultimately, free Princess Peach from being kidnapped.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThat allowed them to generate a lot of wealth, and they decided that they were going to bring the arcade experience to the home. So they're one of the early home console makers, Atari actually might have beat them to it. There's another company Colico, another company in television, all of them watch consoles around the same time in the 80s. And Nintendo’s was the most popular of the many consoles launched - the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985. And I think that the reason that their console worked and the other guys didn't, is that Nintendo had content, that is, Mario to start. They kept expanding their content library, and they've launched consoles since 1990. The Super NES 1997 in ‘64. In 2001, the GameCube. In 2006 The Wii, which was enormously popular. Then they did the Wii U in 2013, which was terrible. And then the Switch in 2017, which has been very good. They've had a ton of handhelds. The Gameboy was the original, Gameboy Color, Gameboy Advance, Gameboy Advance SP, the DSX you know, and then the 3DS before the switch. If any of your viewers have watched the new Apple TV plus movie, Tetris, that's actually the story of how the Tetris Company was formed, and the key was getting on the Gameboy. So the Nintendo platform was so popular that these guys were minting money. But at the same time, they've developed about 30 different big brands on the Nintendo platform that they own. So among them Zelda and Kirby, and the Smash Brothers Mario Kart, and so Mario is the biggest one.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTheir strategy has really not changed much in the last 40 years. They've been focused on the console and their strategy is to create proprietary software meaning software they own for their proprietary console, so the only way you can play their game is to buy their console. And the other guys aren't that way, Sony and Microsoft have consoles, their total sales of first party, their own IP are under 10% of their total revenue. So, you know, Nintendo is more like north of 50 - it has been as high as 80%. So Nintendo has a different strategy than the other guys. And the departure recently from that strategy, which is not meaningful, but it's interesting is that they really started to focus on licensing their IP, and getting opportunities elsewhere. So you start to see them on mobile a bit. They're not really good at it yet. But again, they only own 31% of Pokemon Company, Pokemon Go, it's been a giant mobile title. But the big, big change lately is this Mario Brothers movie.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo the Super Mario movie is really driving a lot of awareness of the brand. And if you roll back, again, you're probably about 1. But back in 2000, there were surveys of the most recognizable brands of the 20th century. And you can look this up to this, this is findable on Google, the number one brand ahead of Coca Cola, you know ahead of anything else was Nintendo. So they are the most recognized brand on the planet. And yet, you know, their cumulative console sales, maybe have hit 250 million households, I don't think that could possibly be even close to a billion households. Yet, there are 3or 4 billion people on the planet who know what Nintendo is.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo the recent strategy shift has been to license the content to other media, like movies, to get even more awareness of the brand. I think you're going to start seeing, you know, Nintendo lunch pails, lunch boxes for the kids, Nintendo pajamas, you know, Nintendo plush toys. And I think that'll work. And ultimately, what that does is drive greater awareness and more interest in the brand, which will help them sell software and hardware. So they do great. They're making tons of money, the hardware sales spiked during COVID. And they've kind of pulled back lately, but we're talking about the difference between, you know, 21-22 million hardware units down to maybe 19, or 20. So it's not like they got cut in half - they just peaked. And now they've plateaued. I don't see a lead up anytime soon. They're due for product refresh. They haven't launched a new console in a while. So probably next year, there should be a Switch 2 or something, some upgraded Switch. And Nintendo has been pretty smart on the hardware side. They try to build their hardware and sell it at a profit so they tend to use commodity components rather than cutting edge technology. If you look at Sony and Microsoft, they both lose money on every console, Nintendo makes money on every console. So as a consequence, their consoles are less powerful than the other two. But their content is great so it doesn’t seem to matter to their fans.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah. And I think you bring up a really important point here, which is this idea that, you know, licensing IP, I think, for most of these companies that we're talking about, but not Nintendo specifically, I imagine the margins can be much higher on licensing IP than they can be on creating technology, creating software and hardware that require a lot of inputs that require a lot of very brilliant minds. And also a lot of parts to be made. You know that that is something that I don't want to discount here.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut getting a little bit more into this idea of how important IP is for Nintendo as a company. Talk to me a little bit more about this. The Super Mario Brothers movie released in North America in early April pulled in around $380 million in its opening weekend, which is way I think out of you know, outperformed a lot of the expectations that were placed out there for this film. It was co-financed by Nintendo and Universal Pictures, how many more big, you know, major scaled projects like that, like a Super Mario Brothers movie do you see coming for Nintendo? You know, is this setting a new precedent for the company in terms of licensing IP or the project is going to be as big as you know, a major film release that blew expectations out of the water? Do you expect more of that?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Pachter: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe economics aren't clear, and I know that the companies announced that the film was co-financed, but my understanding is that Nintendo didn't put any money in. Instead, they contributed the intellectual property obviously, and they lent technical talent so they let their creative developers Miyamoto, who is the head of their studios, to the project to ensure that the characters had brand integrity that they did.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIf you have Mario with five arms or or 10 fingers on each hand, and I think that it's likely that their net net profit on this will be something around, you know, 10% of the total film gross, which is still a big number, this film is going to do $2 billion, when they're all done, I mean, between box office and, and all the different DVD sales and pay per view and streaming service fees and licensing to broadcast TV. So they'll make a couple 100 million dollars, that's enough to get them interested in doing it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAgain, this is one of the bigger projects for Universal. And this is the biggest animated film opening I think of all time. So Universal certainly is going to be interested in doing more and more of this. And for Universal, they make even more money, obviously, because they own the animation studio. So they're going to want to do more and more and more. And there'll be a balance, I think that Nintendo doesn't want to over saturate the market. And they certainly don't want to have any brand failures. But I would expect that you'll see another film within three years. I don't think it's going to be annual for a while.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIt takes a lot to be like Disney and put out, you know, a Marvel film every three months, which they do. I don't think Nintendo is there yet. Could they get to one a year in the next 10 years? Sure. So it's a nice profit contributor, but the bigger impact of the film is just brand awareness that, you know, they end up having, say 500 million people see the film, you know, at most half of those people are Nintendo current customers and the other half are not. And ultimately they're going to win over a whole generation of people who are going to be interested. And it also opens up the opportunity for them to sell, you know, figurines.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAs an example, when the Mandalorian came out, I bought my wife a couple of Growgu characters, and we hadn't seen the show yet. She's like, Why do I want these? And now she thinks they're super cute.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo if Disney's brilliant at Merchandising, and Nintendo has not been. And I expect that Nintendo will get brilliant at merchandising, I think that could open up another couple of 100 million a year of profit. So I can see this company really building on the success of the Super Mario movie, but I can't tell you that they'll do anything for the next two or three years.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Totally, totally. And to your point, you know, the pace with which a company like Disney can put out movies in a franchise like Marvel is astounding. And you know, every single actor in Hollywood these days is somehow tied to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which is wild. But with that in mind, it brings to I think, this conversation the the concept of going back to things that work versus creating a new idea or following some sort of new potential concept idea, or content idea or content concept, you know, when we think about Super Mario Brothers has been around to your point where it's being introduced to a new generation, but it was around for my generation, for the younger people in the generation ahead of me, you know that this not really a new franchise.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd the same goes with Zelda. I know that there's a big release in the Zelda franchise happening next month that a lot of gaming creators are really excited for. But how important is it for Nintendo to come up with the next Mario or the next Zelda? Is that something that you think companies like Nintendo or even Nintendo itself are considering? Or are they really doubling down on returning to what they know works and adding new elements to those franchises that do work versus trying to come up with, you know, totally brand new ideas - blank white sheet of paper trying to figure out what's next?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Pachter: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou know, it's a great question. I don't see Nintendo innovating on their existing brands, you will see them create new brands like Animal Crossing, but new that probably is 10 years old. So it's not like that. That's something they did this past year, in the last 20 years. I doubt that they've done more than two big new brands. They have, I counted not for this interview I counted for another reason, there are 30 brands at Nintendo that have sold multiple millions of units of games. So they have 30 established franchises. I promise you Marvel doesn't have 30. I mean, we think that they have 4000 characters, but they don't have 30 brands. And, you know, Disney's managed to do something with that. DC doesn't have 30. You know, but the difficulty in exploiting those brands is, you know, that you have to create a fun, compelling story around them. And I think with 30 brands, Nintendo's got plenty to continue to pump out, you know, three or four big games a year, movies.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIt's interesting because some brands are really great movies like Guardians of the Galaxy, where the brand itself as a comic book wasn't that big a deal. I mean, it was popular but I don't think anybody in this room, I'd say fewer than 10% of the people who are aware of the Guardians of the Galaxy brand will ever have seen the comic book. They learned about the brand from the movie. And that's the right way to build brands, you know that you don't have to build the brand on the comic book.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo an Animal Crossing movie might be good, or a Yoshi Island movie might be good. But we'll definitely get another Animal Crossing game. And we'll definitely get another Yoshi’s Island game. And as I said, there's so many of them that, you know, I don't think Nintendo has to worry about new IP anytime soon.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTotally - and Animal Crossing. I can't help but ask your perspective on the impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on Nintendo as a business and how Animal Crossing became enormous. People were stuck at home, everybody wanted a Nintendo Switch, they were actually incredibly difficult to get for a time.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI'm curious about how the you know, coming out of the the thick of the COVID 19 pandemic might impact how Nintendo moves forward knowing that they did have this this significant moment in the sun, I would say especially with the switch, which I believe is in its seventh fiscal year next, year heading into its seventh fiscal year next year. So it's not a brand new product, you mentioned that you're expecting some sort of a refurbish or a refresh.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHow do you think Nintendo is going to rise to the occasion to make sure that you know now that everybody is kind of going back to their regular lives, not really at home quite as much, what is Nintendo going to do to make sure that those people want to buy the next generation of a switch?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Patcher\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e: Yeah, I mean, one of the things Nintendo has pioneered and yet failed to exploit adequately is the concept of user generated content. So they've created these Super Mario Maker software packages that allow you to create your own characters and do your own thing. Animal Crossing, let you do that, you can customize your character. And so when I say they pioneered it and failed to exploit, there were brands that were building things inside Animal Crossing. So you could literally wear Burberry, Burberry sweater, or carry a Louis Vuitton bag. And yet, Nintendo failed to exploit that.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo they didn't create a storefront and let you know, only allow the brand to create the Burberry sweater and then let the brand sell you the sweater. And can you imagine if you could buy a Burberry sweater in the game for $1? You know, Burberry would have made 20 million bucks. And why not? Like how does that hurt them? You know, it has 20 million people, you know, wearing their sweater, it helps us. So I think Nintendo is smart. I think their management team is smart. I like the current CEO a lot.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHe'll get that right in the next iteration. So that'll be fun. I think that again, who knows what they're going to do with that next generation switch. But if they allow more creator tools, and they allow you more interoperability, so maybe create something and broadcast that TikTok video or Twitch video through your console, which Sony allows you to do now, I think you get a lot more creative talents. And if you open up the opportunity to create to everybody, you end up enriching the world because you end up with something like America's Got Talent or American Idol, where you get these amateurs who are really talented, and they turn into superstars, you know, so Carrie Underwood, came out came off of a farm in Oklahoma and is a star. And it's hard to know that she would have been discovered but for the opportunity for amateurs to compete, you know, in public.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI think Nintendo exploits that type of concept, and let's amateurs create within the switch to universe. I think they'll come up with really great content, and I think there's an opportunity to make money.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, incredibly interesting. Who's the Carrie Underwood for Nintendo is a fun question to ponder here.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo Michael, I want to talk for a second here about risks and sort of the future, we’ll future cast just a little bit here. You have an outperform rating for Nintendo shares said in a recent report that the stock presents a favorable risk reward profile. I would love to hear you explain that just a little bit and talk to me a little about the risks that might materialize for Nintendo in the medium and long term.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Patcher: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThey're a pretty dependable company. So they're pretty easy to forecast. Their hardware sales, as I said, don't vary by more than 10% either way. So the odds of them forecasting 20 million switch sales coming in at 10, that's pretty close to zero. They forecast 20 that comes in at 18, they're not going to be thrown from profit to loss, they're going to make a little less money. And it's just as likely that it goes from 20 million to 22. They still have the tool in their pocket of price cuts, and they haven't cut the price much if at all. They've introduced three now three models of the switch, they have the switch light, the regular switch, and the switch OLED.\u0026nbsp; I could see them cutting the price of each of those by 50 bucks, and suddenly you would see sales go up. And they'll still make money because the cost of manufacture and shipping has gone way down as the supply chain has gotten more normal.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo I really say low, low low risk on hardware. Software is more a function of release schedule. So you know, if they release a new game, every three months, they're fine. If they miss one, and it takes six months, they might not make as much profit as we forecast. And if they missed two or three, and we go a year or two without, without a new software title, that's a problem. But they've been pretty dependable since the Switch launch that I've seen them really miss anything. You know, delaying Zelda, a few months doesn't matter. That's time value of three months of cash, it's not that big a deal.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo I'd say risks are very, very low. The reward opportunity, you know, the upside is that when they cut price, they surprise us with a better lineup. And we get more software sales. You know, Zelda is not the best selling game of all time, you know, Mario Kart is, the big surprise for upside would be that there's a Mario Kart 9. You know, which the last Mario Kart I think came out in 2014. It's been a long, long time. So they're really due for something like that. That could be huge. And I would guess that that's their next movie. And so I would guess that you're going get Mario Kart game and Mario Kart movie kind of at the same time. And, and that's where I think they surprise the upside. So I, there's more opportunity for them to beat than there is for them to miss.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight. All right. So Michael, this has been wonderful. I have one last question for you for the road. Before we wrap things up here. Just while I have you, Roblox. I would love to get your perspective. Your take on Roblox recently reported monthly key metrics for March that perhaps fell a bit short of expectations. I know you have a neutral rating and a $37 price target for that stock. What are your general thoughts just quickly on Roblox as a company right now,\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Patcher: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThey, you know, they don't disclose their monthly active users, but the number is around 300 million. And that's not even close to saturation. I mean, they could get to a billion users. But the way to do that is to expand the product offering to appeal to people older than 20. And I don't mean to suggest that their content isn’t good, it is. It's just that as you age, you're much more interested in shooter games like Call of Duty, or, you know, role playing games like World of Warcraft.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd so the way to get that type of content is to expand the platform. And the way to expand the platform is to rev share at a higher rate for recognizable content. I think they can. And I actually like their management. And I think that they know that they need to do this, but they haven't done it yet. So I don't see this company getting to the growth implied by its share price until they shift the business model, share more of the revenue with developers and attract games that appeal to older people. And you know, they have a couple of quarters of stagnant growth. That's really what's going on there. The growth is okay, but not as good as people expected. If they have a couple of quarters, stagnant growth, I expect that they'll make a shift. So I'm waiting until it happens. I guess I could forecast the exact date it will happen, but I don't know. If we see an indication that they're going to change them, then we obviously will look at them more favorably, but I haven't seen that yet.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight. All right. Well, we'll just have to check back in at a later date. Michael, this has been so wonderful. Thank you so much for your time and all of your incredible insights. I've really enjoyed this conversation.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichael Patcher: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThank you, Kinsey.

All right, folks. Let's do it. A very cool topic on a very timely day for it and well, we're joined by Mark Mahaney, Senior Managing Director at Evercore ISI, the research division to talk all things Amazon and like I said, what a day for it. Amazon entering the generative AI race through AWS with the introduction of bedrock you may have seen in the headlines the last few hours. It's set to allow clients to leverage and customize AI tools to generate text similar to the way the Chat GPT does. And Mark Mahaney is here who else better to talk about it. We'll also talk a little bit of tech preview as well ahead of earnings season. Mark, thanks for being here. Nice to have you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eGood to be here. Thanks for including me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eAbsolutely. I do need to embarrass you just a bit with a plug. For people who don't know, Mark is also the author of a new book – it’s called “Nothing But Net: 10 Timeless Stock-Picking Lessons from One of Wall Street’s Top Tech Analysts,” and we are doing book giveaways here at Public. So, if you want to get your hands on a copy, just send a DM to the Public live handle. Okay, Mark, thank you for being here. First, congrats on the book, I first want to just get your takeaway for the shareholder letter. It's always nice to hear from Andy Jassy. What most stood out to you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eWhat most stood out is that, like every year, this is kind of a thoughtful review of what's happened to the company over the last year and what their current priorities are for the next year – I know that sounds really basic. I think all CEOs should write shareholders like this. In the book I went through the first 25 first years of the Bezos shareholder letters, and I pulled out key themes from each year. There was a dramatic focus on customer satisfaction and a dramatic focus on innovation – and you kind of still see that here today. But, if there were a couple of new themes that really stuck out, cost – focused on cost efficiencies, and there's a series of items in this letter about how they looked at all of their businesses, whether it was AWS, retail, both international and in the US, their advertising business, the layoffs and just kind of a recognition that demand trends have softened, and they needed to tighten their belts. And so that was one – that was new. I mean, I think you would have seen this in 08-09, you know, back during the great financial crisis, but we haven't had a shareholder letter focus on cost reductions and cost efficiency, so it's a sign of the times.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then I think the second area had to do with innovations in each of the segments. So, in retail, they have sped up deliveries and they talked about Prime deliveries should be at their fastest pace this year like if you're ordering Amazon retail products via Prime, you should get the product faster this year to your home, to your apartment, wherever than you did in the past, that's a good investment. They also tease some of these improvements that you also teased on the AWS side.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then the third point is just a reminder that Amazon's actually been aggressively investing in machine learning and artificial intelligence, you know, for the better part of a decade, and it's in there in terms of the product announcements, the the product feed, or the recommendations that they've given, and it's been in there in terms of the AWS products, the bedrock announcement is a little different. But you know, it's a different level, it’s different scale, but the investments have been there – and so I think they kind of also wanted to use a shareholder letter, Andy did, just to kind of raise his hand and say, “Hey, I know we didn't talk about the last earnings call, but we actually are a machine learning and AI company and by the way, we have been for a decade.” So I thought those were the three most interesting things in the shareholder letter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, we also heard him on that last earnings call as well, which I think all of us that listen in on those sorts of things, we want to hear from someone in that position. We haven't historically, and we don't always from big companies. So that's worth noting as well. I wonder, before we move on, was there anything with regards to macro concerns to how the company is positioned for high interest rates? I don't know that we would hear much directly with concerns over tightening credit or potential credit crunch like we do a lot of other companies, but anything you think, for people to know, in terms of potential way, big picture headwinds for the company?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eI don't think so. The line in here that I'm staring at now is, “While the short term headwinds soften our growth rate, we'd like a lot of funnels now fundamentals that we're seeing at AWS.” So they're acknowledging the short term headwinds, right up front, and they should, because you know, if you step back on AWS, this was a 30% year-over-year revenue grower up until the middle of last year, and now in this March quarter that they're going to print in two to three weeks, the dates not set yet, they're going to print something like 12 13%, like the growth rates have been cut in half in in a year's time, that's always something that's a little bit alarming, and for any company, but I think it's very much a reflection of softening macro environment. And then what Amazon is doing, or AWS is doing to respond to that, which is they're aggressively going after and bringing down pricing in order to help their customers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eSo you mentioned, it seems as if the company was pretty eager to remind people to say, hey, we're still here in the AI conversation, folks who really haven't gotten anywhere, obviously, much of the chatter may sort of be dominated by other names in the space. But talk to me more about what we learned about bedrock specifically, and any other thoughts, Mark that you have, as they look to integrate it into its cloud offering, certainly a big priority for the company at a really important time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, unlike Microsoft, and Google, Amazon's not going to have a generative AI LLM – “Large Language Model” out there. But what they are doing is AWS’ bread and butter has always been selling to devs. What I mean by that is developers, the people who create the large language models, and so they're just that that's kind of what they're doing with bedrock, which is saying that they're rolling out more tools to help LLM developers GAI, that's Generative AI developers, build their models build their tools, that just reminding people that, you know, they, there are tools provider, that's where they're playing in this, this AI race, in addition to doing normal things like storage and compute for their customers.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo I don't know if that's helpful or not, you're going to see them kind of in the weeds on generative AI and in the weeds on LLMS,\u0026nbsp;allowing developers, creators to create and develop those models, rather than, you know, running the flashy front-end consumer service. So that's also why they'll probably be somewhat under-appreciated in terms of their AI competencies. I just think the broad point is, Amazon's fully involved in AI. They've been using it to improve their processes, they've been using artificial intelligence for everything from book selections to you to where in a warehouse where they actually put products so that they can most quickly have people or robots pick up those products and put them in packages and ship them off to you. And then they use it for advertising and they use that in AWS. So that's just a reminder, because I think maybe the market needed one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, well, to that point, do you think the company almost deserves more credit or deserves to be more a part of the active chat GPT AI adjacent conversation?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eYes, they do. But you need to think about them as a company that’s already been investing in machine learning and AI for their core operations. And then when it comes to large language models, which is what Chat GPT is, they're the company – that’s who open AI will use. Actually, I don't know if they use AWS, but the other open AIs because there's a lot of other large language models and applications being built, they'll be built or a substantial percentage of them will be built on AWS. So AWS is kind of the tools vendor, the picks and shovels vendor, to the AI community, to the generative AI community. That's something that I think the market had kind of forgotten.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eSure. Andy Jassy said this morning on Squawk he doesn't focus too closely on the company's stock price. What did data say – it's currently up 4.4%, with under two hours left in training here, you have an outperform rating, if I'm not mistaken, you recently lowered your own price target to 155 from 160. Again, with a bump today, it's trading right around 102. Talk to me about your decision to bid more, Mark, to drop that target and are you still finding yourself being positive for a long term case?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, I can be near term cautious. I do think what he's saying in the shareholder letter, and he's warning people, is that trends are softening\u0026nbsp;even at AWS. And, you know, the facts of the facts, we've had a dramatic deceleration and growth rate, you know, you go from 30% to 10% revenue growth in a year, year and a half. That's not healthy, that's not bullish. And I think that things are likely to get worse at AWS before they get better, but they will get better. And, and for long term investors, which is what I really pitch people to be on Amazon, I pitched that you'd think about Amazon in 2023, is what I would call a DHQ stock, that's the concept that's in my book a “Dislocated High Quality” stock. Another way to think about it is it's a trough multiple stock on trough earnings. And you know, it's cyclical. And as these companies get bigger and bigger, of course, they're more cyclical, you can't escape the economy if you become a bigger, bigger contributor to it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo what I think is so interesting about the setup on Amazon is, there may be a little disappointment about AWS results in the March quarter, or the June quarter guide, but we're going to get revenue growth acceleration as we go into ‘24, for their advertising, business, retail business, and for AWS, and you're going to get margin expansion and improvement and free cash flow. And I'm telling you all that when the stock is sitting here at a multi-year, multiple or trough multiple, a low multiple, and so that's, you know, that's the time when you step in, and you can make money, you may even be dealing with volatility over the next quarter. I don't know that there's a ton of downside volatility, but there'll be some. And I think if you're willing to look out a year, I think this is a great time to buy Amazon shares.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eI don't want to pull the conversation away from Amazon, but I'm hoping quickly, can you talk to us more about DHQs and any other household names people may be familiar with and why they fit that mold?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eGoogle is another one I think that fits that DHQ category. The old saying in the market says buy low, sell high, and I'm kind of saying buy high low. So you know, find a high quality company measured, you know, the book goes through it, but measured on the how good the management team is, how good the level of product innovation is at the company, how large the market opportunities, find those high quality companies and just wait for them to get dislocated, because they all get dislocated because there are market rollovers. That's obviously what we faced in Texas last year. There are mis-executions, because no company is perfect and they’ll make mis-executions. And then when you get those pull backs in the stock, that's when you step in, but first find a high quality company and I'll just take my reputation as I have historically that Amazon is one of those I think Google is to and it seems to me like the fears, you know, the near term and long term fears are well overstated on both of these names. I think they're both very good franchises so those would be two. You know, you can buy at a multiple, you can buy Google and Amazon at about the cheapest multiples you've had a chance to buy at in the last five years. I don't think you're going to regret buying both of those stocks here as DHQ opportunities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eI have all potential opportunities for Amazon, whether it's logistics, groceries, health care, talk to me about what you personally are most excited about. What do you think makes the most impact? Or is it something that maybe we haven't even yet discussed, Mark?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, let me check off some items or count them out. People talking about what Amazon is doing in healthcare - that's always been a head scratcher for me.\u0026nbsp;I'm just not convinced that – I think that's a huge market, but doesn't mean that Amazon should be going into it, so I'm skeptical about that. So I just want to start off with what I'm skeptical about.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat I'm positive about is I think they can be a lot bigger and advertising now that they've just got a lot more content. All of their advertising, most of their advertising revenue so far has come from sponsored ads within their shopping results. But if they start putting advertisements against all of that premium content, video content that they have, I think that's a segment of the business that can double in the next five years, their advertising business. And then I want to get a little bit more blue sky, I talked about this, that logistics business, that buy with Prime. I mean, that's the FedEx competitor, that's the UPS competitor, and I'm pretty damn sure that Amazon's going after that, and it's tiny, tiny, tiny for them now, but I think that its low margin business, but Amazon knows how to handle its low margin businesses, I think that's going to be one.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd then the last one I'd point to is business and industrial supplies. And I think what Amazon's vision here is to, is to connect the world's factories with the world's consumers, and, the world's factories with the world's businesses and people under-appreciate that latter one. And so it's industrial supplies, business supplies, look, Amazon's got the fulfillment network out there. They've got vans and people who deliver products to consumers, it's just a different stop. Now, there's a lot of other things that go into getting into procurement cycles for businesses. But I think that that's a big opportunity. I'm actually surprised they're not figuring that now. So that to me, is kind of one of the sleepers. So, the big sleepers for me are that, advertising and then that logistics business.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eReal quick, not the most important question I'm going to ask you, but what's your favorite show on Amazon Prime since you mentioned content? I ask the important stuff, Mark. I'm a very serious journalist, you know me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eI think you've got me. I can tell you what my favorite books that I've been reading on Amazon Kindle. I'm not much of a movie person. You asked the wrong guy. I apologize.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eNo, no –\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003efair enough. I didn't mean to put you on the spot. Lots of good book options as well. Let me ask you about earnings season, of course, right around the corner. In your last note or a recent note, rather, you say you are tactically constructive. Talk to us more about that line of thinking, what you would want people to know, and some of the key factors that are driving that particularly out there?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so we're making four points. One is that multiples have been de-risked. estimates have been de-risked. What we've had are all these job cuts, you know, cost actions, as painful as they are, over the last year, over the last six months really, these intense rounds of layoffs and, and cuts that's created what I call these EPS slingshot opportunities. This is the third reason why we're more tactically constructive – because when eventually revenue growth really accelerates it is going to do it on a lower cost base. So that means you're going to get a real launch, or slingshot when it comes to earnings. And then the fourth reason why we're tactically constructive, or really constructive is AI. I think there's a lot of opportunities for digitally savvy companies and I think there's a fair number of them in the internet space, to take advantage of AI models and really create something interesting. So I think there are these reasons and so then I'll just end up with what stocks do we like? Well, our number one pick here is meta. Number two pick is Uber. And number three pick is Netflix. Those are 2023 stock picks. If I'm willing to look longer than that, I'm definitely throwing Amazon and Google into the mix.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eNice. Sounds good. That's a great perspective from the great Mark Mahaney, senior Managing Director at Evercore ISI research division. Mark, I encourage you to check out at least a few shows on Amazon Prime. Good stuff there, my man. Thanks for taking the time. Great to get your perspective,Mark.

I'm your host Ann Berry and in this session, we are getting the lowdown or the down low on the high end luxury retail market and diving into the businesses of Hermes and LVMH. With us now is Marie Driscoll, Senior Analyst at Coresight Research to unpack their business models a little further. Marie, thank you so much for joining today.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThank you for having me. It's an honor and a privilege.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMarie, can you just talk about - super high level just to paint the picture for us - the current state of the luxury retail market and how it has been impacted by inflation and a slowing growth outlook?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSure. So this is 2023. New Year, new time. The last few years, you know just to recap, luxury really skyrocketed during COVID luxury products are the most experiential of all products. And while people were locked in, unable to travel, unable to eat out their lives somewhat constrained, they sought luxury products and a lot of people had additional income because you weren't spending on experiences. So luxury became the new experience. And in fact, the luxury market captured a lot of new consumers. As we ended 2022, there's still you know, in America, there's a lot of pent up demand for travel. We were traveling last year to Europe where you saw lots of luxury purchases transpire in Europe, where in 2021, many of them, and in 2020, they occurred in the US market. The U.S. market took over as the number one market in the last few years where it had been like China are the number one consumers it moved to America. We've seen a lot of shifting happen in the last few years. So as we enter this year, you have a shift back to experiences which consumers want to have, they want to travel and travel has inflationary prices of 25 to 50%. Consumers want to eat out, there's inflation across the board, and the economy is somewhat weakening. So that's one backdrop that's happening.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAt the same time, though, you have the China market opening up. We saw that happen in February. China was really under a lockdown last year so luxury really suffered. So as the Chinese began to travel domestically, and then as this year and next year progressed internationally, they will resume their – we assume they'll resume their love affair with all things luxury. So the big things as we head into this year are the pace of the reopening of China post the pandemic and what was a dampened demand for China for luxury by the Chinese is that resume. And then what's happening in the U.S. economy, there's mounting job losses with the Vigilant fed fighting inflation. The stock market is volatile, and these are factors that impact consumer sentiment and their willingness to spend on discretionary purchases.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut as I said, during COVID, we got a lot of new luxury shoppers. It's projected that by 2030, about 75% or more of all luxury purchases will be made by millennials and younger. You have a lot of people that discovered luxury and luxury is sticky. Luxury is better quality. It romances people. It impacts the way people think about themselves. And we believe that they'll be trading down in some more commodity type products, like in the brown beans that you buy, maybe in the jeans that you buy.\u0026nbsp; In apparel, we see a trade down, but luxury we think has stickiness. That said, you know, if you lose your job, you're not going to be buying luxury products.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Let's talk about stickiness, mobile, let's also talk about it in the context of pricing. I feel as though there are constantly these articles being published about how Rolex watches Hermes bags, have seen prices skyrocket under the guise of inflation in part but also because demand seems to have gone up from these new demographics. Can you talk about how price sensitive or not luxury is? Not all luxury is created equal if you break it down by category for us?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e No, no. So not all luxury is created equal and I mean, the real trick of luxury and really any product category is to best match supply and demand. With luxury you want to have demand outpacing supply. And that's what happened during COVID. More people wanted an Hermes handbag or wanted an Hermes bracelet. Then Hermes was able to meet that demand. Some of it was supply chain constraints, and some of that there were more people entering the market that wanted these things.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou also see that in resale if you're a student of the markets, you see that resale has provided pricing transparency into your first purchase. So you could buy a Hermes handbag newer or\u0026nbsp; Louis Vuitton handbag new and see that in the aftermarket, you can get 80 to 150% of what you paid for. So it's brought a new kind of shopper into the market. Also, if you buy in consignment it is where you can often meet that need for a luxury product today. You don't have to wait six months for it. It's In the aftermarket.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNot all products are equal. Certainly Hermes is, you know, unique in its ability to keep consumers panting for demand of you know their Birkin bag or their Kelly bag. But, and you've seen while Gucci was really driving incredible demand through COVID. By the end of COVID. Really, it became.. it was time to move on to another product. So partly as luxury becomes entwined with high priced designer brands, designer design and fashion are different than true luxury.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd let's talk a little bit about where Hermes and LVMH specifically fall on the luxury pricing spectrum. Marie, do you expect the higher end brands like there to be more recession proof than mid tier luxury brands? I mean, as you look at overall demand as distinct printers, price sensitivity, where do you see those learned?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThere are two different companies. Hermes has this one brand with sub-brands. Birkin is a brand, but it's really one brand, Louis Vuitton is a company that consists of about 80 different luxury brands. So with LVMH you're getting incredible diversification that spans Sephora and beauty, which is our entry points for luxury and in fact is holding up quite well. DFS, which is another part of their selective retail group. But they have some real winners with Louisville Vuitton and Christian Dior and then they have some more fashion brands like a Kenzo that are more vulnerable to an economy than the LDN, then the Louis Vuitton. And then of course, you have Tiffany's, you have all their jewelry lines.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo what we saw in 2008 and 2009, is that luxury did not go down as low as other categories and it rebounded more quickly than other consumer discretionary categories. And we think that that will be the case again, this, you know, in this current economic environment, and frankly, this environment is nowhere near what 2008 or 2009 was with the Great Recession. Right now, like we're not even sure if we're in a recession, right? \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnne Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMarie, yes. So I think we're not sure if we're in a recession now and it's much more about the outlook. You've talked about Asia demand. Let's call it something else geopolitically that's different today versus in 2008 and that's the impact on Russian demand for luxury goods. Talk to us a little bit about what demand from Russia has looked like in the past and where it stands now, given the conflict with Ukraine?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight. So Russia, it is not a support as it was in 2008 or2009. Or, you know, it was part of the picture. But now you have a growing UAE, you have a youth that is entering the luxury market. And so I think that, you know, what's different now is there's more people in the market. We recently presented a Shop talk and in 2000, when we entered this century, 3% of the Chinese were in the middle class, by 2018 53% were. I mean, you have a huge middle class of 700 million people that buy luxury. They may buy low, and they have pent up demand from COVID for the last two years. So that's going to help them this year. The UAE has always sought luxury, but now they're bringing it to their own territory and we see a lot of demand coming there, which will offset the loss of the Russian consumer.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTalk to us a little bit too, Marie, about direct to consumer and how luxury has been able to sell online, you know, you think about the stereotypical luxury experience, it's very much in person, it's tactile, you see the product, you feel the product, you try the product, if you're paying such high prices, has that evolved?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo their pricing is consistent, you know, the luxury brands are going direct to consumer because they can, they're in selected points of distribution where they want to be often they're renting space in a wonderful department store like a Bergdorf Goodman, and Neiman Marcus or Saks Fifth Avenue or Bloomingdale's. But going direct to consumer means that you hope that you have control of your messaging at all points, and your adjacencies.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDuring COVID we saw and we continue to see throughout America, that luxury brands are opening more direct to consumer out physical stores to be where the consumer is because during COVID many consumers moved from metro areas to urban and rural areas. We just did a survey in China and it's more important for the Chinese that they want to discover luxury in physical store locations. And another interesting facet is that they're influenced more by their friends than they are by a KOL. So I urge you folks to check out Coresight’s research and look for our most recent survey on the China luxury consumer. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut so, but direct to consumer is just a way for them to really control what they look like in every point of sale and online. You can get selected products but luxury, is experiential, as you said, and not all the apparel is going to be or the ready to wear, not all the collection is going to be available online. But it's as easy as during COVID the consumers picked up the phone and call their sales associate. And and they were doing one to one selling kind of like one to one live shopping.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMarie, just to finish our conversation, which has been just so interesting. With respect to Hermes and LVMH in particular, can we just go back to something you touched on early, which was the second hand market? We know that both Hermes and LVMH generate about half their revenue from the leather goods category, which is one secondhand market? And then you've got jewelry and others? Can you talk about the second hand appetite for those different product categories?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, so I know better the second hand you know, the RealReal's of the world, the best year collective. A lot of it is the leather goods, you know, if you're a shopper and you love luxury goods and you buy some luxury clothing, you see that it drops, unless it's the most iconic of pieces, it drops in value, like 50 to 80%. The handbags hold their value, as I said before, and you get 80 to 150% of what you pay for. The thing about the secondhand market is that you can attract a new consumer to your brand there. A lot of brands, luxury, contemporary are bringing resale on their own branded platform so that they can keep that connection with the consumer. And there's been advances in technology and tagging so that luxury brands can keep track of who owns their product.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAll this is to say that secondhand is really very viable. A luxury shopper cares about sustainability. And this secondhand is a feature of sustainability. It shows a prolonged life, it validates a purchase and it validates quality, something that has an extended life. An interesting feature that has come out with the recent RealReal report is that consumers are looking for vintage products and they're looking for handbags that are in fair condition, not necessarily in excellent condition because they want a handbag with the patina of use, which is really interesting. They want to look like they've owned this handbag for 10 years not for you know the last month. Interesting, right?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThat is very interesting.\u0026nbsp; And part of my last question, which comes to mind if you can get your crystal ball out for us, Marie, and look at the next six to 12 months out? How do you see that trend evolving? And what are some other evolving consumer and luxury retail trends you can see coming.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarie Driscoll: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo I think luxury holds up. I think that, you know, depending on how bad the economy is, you will see an impact. It's more muted in luxury but it you know it does participate in the economy. I think you'll see perhaps people trading into second hand also monetizing what they have in their closet to support their next luxury purchase.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAdditionally, beauty will do well. Beauty has become a form of wellness, it's a form of taking care of oneself. So all the and fragrance has become more important in terms of self expression and taking care of oneself. So I think that we're going to see beauty grow, and you see that caring brings beauty in house. So beauty will become a more important feature of overall luxury and luxury will hold up and luxury has less volatile earnings and they can sooner you know, slow down their manufacturing and again keep their supply demand that equation in balance.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWith that Marie Driscoll thank you so much for joining us Senior Analyst at Coresight Research.

We're going to be covering lots of things from The possible TikTok ban and its potential impact. With us today, once again is Mark Mahaney, senior managing director and head of the internet research team over at Evercore ISI. He is also the author of a new book titled Nothing But Net 10 timeless stop picking lessons from one of Wall Street's top tech analysts and we are doing a book giveaway. So if you want to get your hands on a copy, just send a DM to the public live handle. You see it right there on the top of your screen, folks. All right, it's time to get into it. Hi, Mark. Welcome back to public life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Hey, Kori. Good. Hey, good to hear you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, it's good to hear you too. A lot of change actually Mark since I last talked to you. I don't know if you're aware a lot in the financial industry has changed. But today we're gonna focus on the tech stuff and what's happening with TikTok, I mean, the company's CEO, he provided that testimony. He was on Capitol Hill this morning, where he really received some tough, tough criticism with one lawmaker even stating, and I quote, I expect today, you'll say anything to avoid this outcome, but we are not buying it. What were your takeaways from the TikTok CEOs testimony?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e I hope that none of my children ever have to go on the Capitol Hill and testify with the weekend that he had, I wouldn't wish that fate on my greatest enemy. So I'm sorry to carry on being kind of glib about it. But that was, you know, I respect him. And I respect him for going up there and taking that, it's kind of like Zuckerberg, you know, in the last year or two or two years ago, being brought up to Capitol Hill to testify. It's kind of like the leaders of tech being brought up there Bezos and, and Tim Cook, etc, are being brought up to testify that was just unfortunately for TikTok, they're going up against two major issues, social health concerns, related to social media usage. And then much more importantly, these days is national security issues. And so, you know, you knew that the question was just how much defense he could play in that time, and I didn't watchall of the testimony. But that's what I was just struck by and I think maybe more importantly, just today's testimony, the action question for all of us as public market investors because we can't invest in TikTok or, or at least not as a separate standalone asset. I don't think we'll ever see it that way, is what are the implications of this for other social media assets, specifically, Snap, Meta, and Google? And I think the probability of TikTok getting banned in the US is just increasing, you know, relatively materially over the last 12 months. I know there are a lot of constitutional issues around this. And I think they're very serious. But I just think that the odds of some sort of ban or major restriction have increased materially. And so that's kind of a pending catalyst. And anytime the news flow comes up, you'll see names like Snap and Meta outperform on that day, which is what you're seeing today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e You know, I feel what I'm hacking a little bit more in terms of the broader social media context, because you did reference, you know, Zuckerberg having to go up there kind of, you know, defend all the stuff that Facebook, you know, had going on all the negative things specifically, right, that was happening. I mean, you even saw back in the day with Dorsey, he had to go there. Back when he was still leading his company. He co-founded Twitter. I mean, you see it across the board, it doesn't seem to be net like it doesn't seem to be ending anytime soon. And one of my takeaways from what happened today with TikTok, specifically, Mark is that I feel like they're also getting the brunt of all of the aforementioned right, big social media companies. It's like they've had enough time at the batting cage, right? With the Facebooks, with the Googles of the world, with the Snaps that now they're just ready to unleash completely on TikTok.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Kori, I think that's right. But no, but don't forget this. I mean, we got a major political issue, growing political tensions between the US and China. And that's what made this tougher, I think, than anything that the tech companies had to face before because, you know, they,Those are US companies, you know, presenting in front of their elected representatives. That's not the case with TikTok and at the moment when relations between the US and China are at the lowest that they've been and, you know, I'm no expert on that. But um, in some time and maybe decades, so it's just, there's just a lot of different angles here that made it much tougher for TikTok to come through and again, it's kind of hard to see a political out here because it looks to look from where I stand it, it looks like the US military has banned Tiktok from personnel devices, personal and personnel devices. You've had more states do that. You've had a federal government do that you'd like that. That's from government-owned devices. So you've already gotten pretty far down the path here. You've never had that happen with any of the other apps. So and that's not because there's a greater social health issue related to TikTok than there was to Snap or to Facebook. It's because of the Chinese national security issue. So that this is just a bigger, this is just my this is more explosive of an issue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e No, it definitely is something else that you brought up earlier is that you know, you don't think there will ever really see TikTok, as a standalone kind of investable company where people like you or myself, your company would be able to then you know, buy shares in TikTok, it is owned by ByteDance. However, are there some scenarios perhaps in your mind Mark that could play out if TikTok were forced to sell or spin on where it could become, you know, a company at some point that you are I could invest in?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well I don't think so. There was an article in the papers this morning in China that the Chinese government for the first time made an official statement that they would be strongly opposed to a forced sale of TikTok. So I mean, I'm no expert on China, I just assumed that there would be some statement that would come out along the way to this effect. Well, it's out. So I think that's why a ban is such a distinct probability, because I don't think ByteDance will be allowed, even if they wanted to, and I don't think they want to, they wouldn't be allowed to sell TikTok to a US company. So TikTok's in the middle of a geopolitical Firestorm that's, it's unfortunate for them. And you know, I give them all credit. This is a highly innovative company now, whether they actually create a national security risk, that's, you know, there are thorough, thoughtful arguments on that. But anyway, that probably matters. Neither here nor less, it doesn't matter now, Kori, we're not gonna be able to get the chance to invest. So let's focus on the companies that could be derivatives of there. That's Meta. Alphabet because of YouTube and Snap. And I really do think sometimes we spend a little too much time on Snap as a derivative. I think that the use case you know, for those who have used TikTok a lot, you think about what other assets like Snap is more of a communications tool than that kind of leaned forward entertainment tool. That TikTok is but the analogies are really, Instagram and YouTube and those would be the beneficiaries where they were TikTok to be banned.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Okay, that was a foreign mission company is like Google because of YouTube likes Facebook, obviously, also owns Instagram. This is a perfect lead into my next question, because I know over at Evercore, you guys recently hosted a panel with three experts who collectively oversee $1 billion in ad budgets, these are companies that have really been struggling right in the ad space. But the panel revealed some signs that this ad a winter it could be starting to thaw, could you provide some insight into what you're seeing in the ad space, and how we could you know, positively impact some of those other companies that we could invest in?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I think we're still in an ad winter, I think that's what we've uncovered so far with, with the channel checks that we've done, maybe that's not terribly surprising. And, you know, there's a broadening consensus that, that we do have a recession coming. So you know, we could be staying in an ad winter for quite some time. I don't think we're going to see crocus's anytime soon. I think Kori, those are the first plants that show up in the snow out of the snow, but you're also into horticulture Mark, you're a man of many talents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e And somebody can correct me on my pronunciation of crocus's. But, but, but I, I don't, I don't think we're gonna get a quick V shape recovery in marketing spend in advertising spend. And so that's going to be a bit of a drag on some of these names. The advantage and one of the reasons we like Meta frankly, one of the reasons it's our number one recommendation is you don't need to believe that to be long Meta, because they've taken so many of the costs out of their business. And then they've got this new reals, monetization, and they're doing much better targeting than they were years ago. And if you've got this new ad format called click to messaging, click the message which is used much less than the US but it's widely used outside of the US especially in areas of the world like Latin America and parts of Asia. And that's, that's a it's a brand new there's like a product cycle here. You need a product cycle because the overall market is getting soft, and it's not good. It's not firming up yet it's not getting better. And we're still in an ad winter and you know, we should probably assume we're gonna continue to be one for as it's gonna be a long winter it's gonna be several more months at least.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Mark I don't know. I remember you being this type of pessimistic in terms of the ad winter continuing and then you brought up the dreaded R word recession, goodness, a lot of things in what you just said that are very important takeaways. I'm gonna keep it moving, though, because Amazon, this is a company that has been doing a complete like 180 in terms of its firing, it's not doing the speed hiring anymore. They just announced on Monday, they're gonna lay off another 9000 employees. Do you have any thoughts on this mark?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I think the big backdrop here is actually I thought Amazon was the first of the major tech companies to acknowledge that they had over hired overbuilt during the COVID crisis, they said this on their march 22 earnings call that was the that would have been last April, so about a year ago, but then they didn't really act on it. Whereas I think Facebook didn't acknowledge it early, but then they acted on it by laying off a good number of employees. Look, these layoffs are they're no fun for anybody there painful for all people involved. I've gone through it. And, so I wish it on nobody but you know, just as consumer households have to tighten their belts when times get tough. So do corporations, and especially those that over-hired and over-extrapolated from COVID demand trends. And Amazon was one of those, you could actually look they grew their expenses faster than they grew their revenue, and their revenue grew quickly, from 2019 to 2022. So they did overbuilt, they acknowledged it, and they needed to do one or two rounds of cuts, and they've done the two rounds of cuts. As long as we don't go into a steep recession, I don't think they need to do another round of cuts. But doing those cuts was necessary. You also had a bit of a change in but you've had a major change in management over the last two years. It's given a new CEO who's been with the company for 20 years. So he's not new to Amazon by any means. But it gets given them some time to maybe look through all the portfolio of bets, and assets that Amazon hasn't maybe pair some things back maybe not lose $10 billion a year on Alexa, which was a reported number, which was terrifically high. So anyway, I think I think that's kind of what you're getting out of Amazon, which is they're getting deep now into belt-tightening. And I do think that at the end of the day, when we come out of this, and when we get back to more normal economic times, companies are going to be doing this on the lower cost base. And that means you create what I call these EPS slingshot opportunities. So when the revenue recovers on a lower cost base, that means that earnings can grow much faster. And that can be a great long equity opportunity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Let's definitely hope that it will be really quick, Mark, before I get you out of here. I know that you are recently out in Las Vegas for the PROSPER show, which is a gathering of E-commerce sellers and solution providers just really quickly for all the rest of us who were not able to attend the show. What insights did you take away about the Amazon marketplace from that show?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, it's still remarkably a positive experience for most sellers that are on there. And I think you're seeing a lot of them. I guess one of them the most part, the single most interesting takeaway for me was, I think it was 8 out of the 10. Amazon Marketplace, sellers that we spoke to are currently using advertising on Amazon. And Amazon don't tell anybody this but they're generating close to $40 billion a year in advertising revenue, they're going to be the next $100 billion a year ad revenue company. And that's not going to be next year or the year after. But sometime in the next three to five years. They'll be up there. I mean, they're gonna be in spitting distance of Facebook and Google. And because it's a high-intent platform and marketers and advertisers love to be in high-intent platforms. So that was probably the biggest takeaway. Merchants really like advertising on Amazon, watch this space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Wow. Well, the faculty said they're going to be in spitting distance of those big behemoths like Google and Facebook. That's definitely something to watch. As always, we love when you come on Public lot to share your insights. Once again, everyone this is Mark Mahaney, the senior managing director and head of internet research team over at Evercore ISI.

All right. Let's do it. Folks. Welcome one and all public live. I'm your host this afternoon. JD Durkin. I'm so happy to be here with all of you today learning about the evolving air transportation space and how Blade is bringing innovation to the world of travel. I am thrilled to welcome our special guests for the afternoon. Will Heyburn the CFO of blade welcome to Public Live. Great to have you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill Heyburn:\u003c/strong\u003e Thanks so much for having me very excited to be here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin:\u003c/strong\u003e Of course my man. It's great to have you. So Blade provides of course air transportation alternatives to pretty congested ground routes. And for those of us who live in New York City, we know that that's basically a daily occurrence. And you bring those alternatives to communities all around the world. Will, help break down Blades passenger segment offering and its value add.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill Heyburn:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, so just real quick, you know, Blade is really focused on those use cases for air mobility that can be profitable today. So we're laser-focused on areas where you have that addressable market of customers where we can save them a tremendous amount of time, for a price that's going to be competitive to ground transportation. As a reminder, we're doing this in an asset-light fashion, we don't own or operate any aircraft. And that's what allows us to grow so quickly expand so quickly, and do it in an extremely capital-efficient way. This also allows us to be really nimble between different markets, depending on the macro environment, and be 100% Ready for the future electrification of air mobility, which we think will be coming soon with electric vertical aircraft that are gonna allow you to fly more quietly, which means communities are going to let you land more places, but are also going to let you do that in a more cost-effective manner. So we're focused on doing that and both passenger and medical where we're the largest transporter of human organs in the United States for transplant. But I'll start with your question. On passenger. Like I said, we're laser-focused on places where we can save folks a huge amount of time. And so for us today, that's in Canada, Western Canada, between Vancouver and Victoria, where we're taking what would be a three four-hour journey of car trips, Ferry rides, and we're turning that into a 30-35 minute helicopter flight between Vancouver and Victoria landing right in the middle of the city center for between $200 and $300. We're also in New York City where you already mentioned, we can take your two to three-hour trip between Manhattan and JFK make that a five-minute flight that starts at $195. If you're trying to get an Uber in New York, you know, it can often be more expensive than that. And then we're in southern France flying between Nice and Monaco, for about $200. That's a seven-minute flight. And also between Nice and Saint Tropez. And in the winter we fly between Geneva of course Courchevel and other ski destinations. These are the places in the world where for not a lot of money for something that costs very similar to what you might pay for ground transportation, we can save our customers a tremendous amount of time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, that's awesome to hear. And it's very appealing to me. I live in Queens and yet JFK is also in Queens Yet somehow it still always takes me an hour just to get to JFK. So I'm sure there's more than a few of us listening to your last response. You say, Oh, my goodness, that sounds like a great alternative versus the MTA Blade does not only offer passenger transportation services well, but like you said, a growing medical transport segment. Let's talk the numbers though it reached $71.8 million in Q4 revenue growing 120%. Year over year. What is this segment entail? And why do you think you've been able to experience such high growth?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill Heyburn:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, so just a quick clarification, the $71.8 million is the full-year revenue for 2022. But you're right. It's been growing triple digits year-over-year organically for the last several quarters, incredibly fast growth. And you know, the interesting thing about how we got started in medical, for better or for worse in New York City, we've always had 24/7 availability of crews, largely in case somebody wanted to go to Atlantic City in the middle of the night, which used to happen all the time. And we realized one day we've got all these aircrafts sitting around ready to go, incredibly affordable prices. Because we're flying them all the time to airports out to Long Island, we realized that we could actually help the hospitals here in New York, and we could provide them service to go pick up organs and get do it much more cost-effectively and much more quickly than any of the providers they've been using before. So we started just in our own home base here we're based in New York City, working with NYU Langone, we added Mount Sinai and we very quickly became the largest transporter of human organs here in the Northeast. And we realized it's the same aircraft for organ transportation. So quick primer on organ transportation. There's a group called UNOS here in the United States. This is the governing body that allocates organs to potential transplant recipients so that organization is going to say this donor could be a match with this recipient. And then they turn it over to the quarterback of any transplant mission, which is the transplant center or the hospital that is going to be putting that organ inside the recipient. So that is our customer. That is our credit. We don't have to deal with any insurance. We don't have to deal with reinsurance reimbursements. We're always getting paid from that hospital, that's our customer and they're generally two to three-year contracts. But where we really shine is all the same jets that we might be using for you to go between Palm Beach and New York City or the helicopters that we're using during the day to fly between JFK and Manhattan. Those same aircraft are what we utilize primarily at night to move organs for these hospitals. And you may or may not know, one of the biggest components of the cost of flying aircraft is the fixed costs, the salaries for the pilots, the liability insurance, and the lease payment you might pay as an operator to lease that aircraft from a lessor. Those are all costs that are borne by our network of third-party operators. But they also cost that if you fly more hours, you're now amortizing that fixed costs over more hours. So it actually costs you less to fly. So that's the magic of putting those two businesses together and Blade by having use cases during the day for our passengers. And use cases that are primarily at night for medical, we can offer the operators that fly on our behalf more hours, and we can eliminate some of their fixed costs, for example, they don't need customer service anymore, because we're doing all that mostly with our technology. And because they're flying that fixed costs over more hours, it costs everybody less to fly, they make more money, and we can pass through some savings to hospitals. And we have a very competitive product, we think the lowest-cost product in the United States to move organs for hospitals, and it allows them to go after more potential transplants. That's another really important point and our organ transportation business, because we're asset-light because we have aircraft distributed across the United States, ready 24/7. We can source an aircraft, that's not only the exact right size that a hospital needs at the exact right time, but increasingly at the exact right place. So it's a fragmented industry, most hospitals used to work with a mom-and-pop operator of a couple of aircraft that were based right near their hospital. The problem with that is that every trip needs to be a round trip. And a lot of times in organ transportation, you think you might pick up an organ and then pawn visual inspection, it's actually not going to be a match for the recipient. So if you're working with an operator that's based right near where you are, you're always going to have to pay for that full round-trip transportation, if you're working with Blade will have an aircraft on standby near the location where the donor is located, you can visually inspect that organ. And if it's not a match, you only pay a couple $1,000, you can imagine how overtime over a year, it costs the hospital so much less. And it also enables them to go after more organs. So you know, it's exciting that this is a great growing business. It's profitable for Blade on a segment-adjusted EBITA basis. But it's even more exciting for me and the team here that we have enabled hospitals to go after more organs than they otherwise might have been able to, because they have the confidence that not they're not going to be stuck with the bill.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin:\u003c/strong\u003e Will, I'd like to ask you a little bit about maybe some potential headwinds or challenges in this particular macroeconomic environment. Obviously, for all the talk about a recession, a lot of people are just sort of looking at the jobless claims and the numbers and the job cuts. And they're saying this a little bit more of a tech session or maybe a rich session. And given your kind of client base there. Are you seeing that kind of squeeze in terms of consumer spending among wealthier clientele, given some of the jobless numbers that we've seen across the country? And how, you know, some demographics of spenders may be hit more than others?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill Heyburn:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, well, look, we think we've built an incredibly resilient business on both sides of the house on the passenger and medical side. Obviously, on the medical side, it's hard to get more recession-proof than saving folk's lives by moving in organs, where you got one moment in time to get that to a recipient who needs it to save their life. But on the passenger side, we have extremely resilient customers, as we talked about even looking quarter to date as of our earnings call last week. For passenger, we're seeing a near doubling of our airport business in New York versus the prior year period, we had a record for airports here in New York, we've seen great results from being able to take price increases in some of our key markets, like New York to Long Island, where some routes we raise price up to 30%. We think we have great pricing power. We think we're targeting a unique group of people that's extremely resilient in any economic environment. And then the most important thing is right, we've got that asset light model. So if you look at our gross profit margin across the last several years, even through the pandemic, when of course, on the passenger side of the business, we saw a significant drop of volumes, what you saw is that our flight margins stayed very strong. That's because we don't have the fixed cost associated with flying that you would have if you owned a bunch of aircraft. So we're incredibly nimble. And if you ever did need to reallocate resources between medical and passenger or throttle capacity up or down, you'd be able to do that and still maintain really strong flight profit margins. Now, we haven't seen anything to suggest that there's any weakness in our flyer, but we're incredibly cool. afforded by the fact that we've got these two complementary business lines using the same aircraft assets to fly. And the asset-light model gives us a tremendous amount of flexibility. So I'm incredibly excited. I'm excited that we're still seeing growth, significant growth, particularly in markets like New York City. So so we're really feeling good at any macro environment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin\u003c/strong\u003e: Absolutely. I do want to try and squeeze in these last two if I can first in the in the last quarter Blade completed its first test flights of an EVA, that's electrical vertical aircraft. You mentioned it a bit earlier with its partner Beta Technologies. Talk to us a bit more about EVA's and Blade's ambitions for this new aircraft, if you can.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill Heyburn:\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely, we think this could be an incredible boost to the passenger and the medical business. On the medical side of the house. There are a lot of areas where you don't have access to rotorcraft, they're just too remote. And those machines are too expensive to be based on air all the time. And as a result, you might have a two-three hour drive to the nearest airport from a hospital where a donor is sitting, a heart only has four hours in transit. So it kind of takes them out of the running to get it anywhere except somewhere local. If you had a less expensive electric vertical aircraft or even a drone. Now you could go after organs that maybe you couldn't otherwise do on the passenger side of the business. Everything we're doing that 10-200 mile trip is specifically designed with electric vertical aircraft in mind. And the most important thing I can stress is that these aircrafts are quiet. The number one limiting factor in terms of creating new places that we can land is the noise that the community believes that helicopters could bring. By bringing an aircraft that's near silent and flight completely silent the moment after it shuts, it sits down because you can turn those rotors off immediately. Unlike a turbine holograph copter where they have to keep spinning, you can start adding new spokes onto our key hubs. So we have exclusive terminal infrastructure in places like New York, no one else has a heliport terminal at West 30 Street, East 34th street, you simply couldn't offer a service like ours in New York City, if you didn't have those exclusive terminals that we have. What we see from EVA is creating new places to fly to and from those key hubs that we had, if you had a heliport in Stamford, Connecticut, people could start commuting in, but it'd be very difficult to compete with us if you didn't have the infrastructure we have in New York City. So we're really employing a strategy of building those key hubs, those locations where urban air mobility can be profitable today with helicopters, building that moat in terms of customers that already fly the infrastructure that's exclusive to our technology that's specifically designed to operate this mission and a brand that's recognized around the whole world at this point so that when those electric vertical aircraft are ready for commercial use, we're already the market leader and we've got a huge head start.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin:\u003c/strong\u003e Finally, here Will, before I let you go, United Airlines previously invested $15 million into Air Mobility and also agreed to purchase 200 of its EVA's electrical air taxis. Talk to me about how Blade is viewing competition as an industry in terms of electrical air taxis and as the industry develops\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill Heyburn:\u003c/strong\u003e As we've learned from our passenger and a medical business, you know, one size fits all does not apply to aviation, you need a different aircraft to fly an organ between New York and Boston than you might use to just fly that five minutes between JFK and Manhattan. So we're all about having a diversity of aircraft in our accessible fleet. And that's why we're staying in Switzerland and the electric vertical aircraft business, we're going to use the best aircraft for any given mission, our asset-light model allows us to pick the winners in terms of what aircraft is going to be most appropriate for each market, we're not putting a stake in the ground in terms of we have to use this aircraft here, this aircraft there. So we're very excited to work with all the electric vertical aircraft manufacturers, to the extent they create an aircraft that's going to work for our customers from a payload and cost perspective. So there's a lot still to learn about electric vertical aircraft. And Blade gives you the optionality, right? We've got customers, we've got them on roofs where we can make money, even with helicopters. And so if electric vertical aircraft are going to be slightly less expensive, which is what all the manufacturers today do, we can feel very confident that they should work well on the routes we're already operating. And we do not have our hands tied in terms of having to use one particular kind of aircraft because it's hard to know at this stage, who's going to be first to market and which aircraft is going to make the most economic sense. So we're trying to cast a wide net rather than pigeonhole ourselves with one particular manufacturer or one particular route, one particular place. So we think we're set up to be much more flexible than the competition and you know, at the end of the day, we have the customers and we have the passengers that are already flying. You can take a jog on the West Side Highway and you can see people getting into a Blade helicopter every 15-20 minutes. And we think that's going to make all the difference. Right on\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJD Durkin: \u003c/strong\u003eAlright, that's Will Heyburn CFO of Blade. Will, thanks a lot for taking the time. It was a great conversation.

Happy Thursday and welcome to Public live. I am your host Kinsey Grant. So on Tuesday of this week, financial technology company MoneyLion released its Q4 and fiscal year 2022 earnings reports, so joining me to walk through the numbers and tell us more about MoneyLion and its future is Rick Correia, CFO of MoneyLion.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRick Correia: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHi, thanks for having me.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOf course.

Before we dive into the nitty gritty and the details of their earnings reports. Can you just explain to anybody who might not be familiar with MoneyLion what you do? Tell me about the company?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRick: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, absolutely. At our core, we help connect customers with the right product, financial product, so whether that's a first party product or a third party product, you know, it's an authentic way for us to give our customers advice and content and at the same time, just making sure that you have all their financial needs met.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAbsolutely, certainly makes a ton of sense. So let's get into the earnings report from earlier this week. So on the earnings call, you reiterated three key takeaways for investors. I would love it if you could recap what those three key takeaways were for our listeners today.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRick Correia: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, so let me just, I want to read something from the Fun Police or lawyers, which is that as we're going through the financials or anything that I'm talking about, unless it's otherwise stated, I'll be referring to our non-GAAP adjusted results. And so you can see the appendix in our earnings release available on our IRS site for any of our GAAP results and reconciliations of each non-GAAP measure to the comparable GAAP measure. And then, of course, you can always find our latest earnings presentations on moneyline.com.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo with your question, in terms of the three key takeaways that we highlighted on our earnings call, the first was that we reached a significant milestone, which is we reached positive adjusted EBITDA in the month of December. This also marked our fourth consecutive quarter of adjusted EBITDA improvement. And so we're really proud of this milestone we've been working towards optimizing growth and profitability. And as everyone can appreciate a really dynamic market environment.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe others that we announced that we expect to generate positive adjusted EBITDA for the full year of 2023. There aren't many of us in this kind of competitive space that can say that. And it's another great milestone for us as we turn the quarter corner towards delivering really kind of profitable growth at scale. And then we also surprise the analyst community by being months ahead of our EBITDA targets. So in terms of our Q4 results, our Q4 adjusted EBITDA came in ahead of expectations at the 6 million adjusted EBITDA or negative Don number was an improvement from 32 million a year prior and Q4 ‘21. And this was really driven by the performance in our consumer business, seeing the continued benefits of a lot of the operating leverage that our business was built to realize as well as around 15 million of annualized run rate, fixed cost savings that we actioned during the fourth quarter.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe second takeaway that was important for our investors is that we added over a million total customers in Q4. And we did that at a remarkably low CAC, which you've probably been following us is really kind of one of the things that differentiate us, and that's under a $10 CAC. And so we've been able to grow while actually reducing our marketing spend, and specifically reducing it with the paid digital channel. So you know, when you look at the Googles and the Facebooks of the world, those channels are becoming increasingly expensive. And so we benefit from having a unique way in terms of driving our top funnel. And we do that by having over 30 million inquiries a quarter. You know, that gives us a tremendous number of customers data and importantly intent that we can then optimize to, as I said at the beginning of this match customers with the right suite of products.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe third key takeaway is that we reached quarterly adjusted to be EBITDA of 92 million in Q4 of ‘22, and this is up 70%, over the prior year quarter. And so for the full year of 2022, we had an adjusted revenue that increased nearly 100%, year over year to 328 million. And so because of this kind of diversified consumer and enterprise business model, we're able to continue delivering really strong performance across economic cycles. And so that's really the kind of key three takeaways that we wanted our investors to take away from the business update that we provided yesterday.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAwesome. Yeah, I appreciate all that insight. And I think that we'll get more into this consumer and enterprise product lineup in just a couple of minutes here. But before we do get to that, with all of these key takeaways in mind, knowing that there are some pretty impressive stats and you know, some important numbers that you and your team shared earlier this week, I would love if you could just explain the context behind all of this, you know, not necessarily how you got there, but more so what does this mean? What do these big three key takeaways mean, for investors - for adding value for investors? Tell me a little bit about that.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRick Correia: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, so when you look at why these matters, so much for us is one, it's unique for a company that has kind of both our growth trajectory and profitability trajectory, to meet the needs of our customers in such a meaningful way. And so whether our customers are experiencing, you know, times of need, or they have times of excess, we're able to deliver for them, either our first party or our third party products. And so when you think about the context of this, we exited the year, with 6.5 million total customers. And so our definition of customers are monetized customers, as opposed to just those that kind of browse our platform. And that's important, because it means that we're going to be delivering value to them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe second reason, when you look at the number of products that were taken by those customers, it's nearly 13 million. And so that's a really nice blend of both first party products that we provide, as well as third party products. And so it means they're actually meeting the needs of our consumers. And then we ended the year with over 1000 enterprise partners. And we'll touch upon this a bit more later, when you look at what we have, from an enterprise business perspective, we have one of the leading financial marketplaces out there. And so that means that we're helping our customers kind of get matched with product providers so that we're meeting their needs authentically. And then we amassed over 33 million unique customer profiles across our platform. And so what's really important about that is if you look at the recurring revenue profile of both of our consumer and enterprise businesses, it means that our customers are coming back to us, because we're actually helping them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo on the consumer side, for example, over 75% of our revenue comes from our historical cohorts, whether it's kind of pre 2019, or 2020, or 2021, and even 2022. Every day that we wake up, over 75% of our revenue are coming from customers that we acquired historically. And then on the enterprise side, we have a similar type of profile, we have over 80% of our enterprise customers that represent revenue – recurring revenue that we are realizing. And so what does that mean, again, we wake up every day, and we are generally generating over 80% of our revenue in the enterprise side from historical cohorts.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThen just digging down into the customers. You know, the thing that we have been proud about doing within MoneyLion is having some of the leading unit economics. So we've kind of talked about the customers that we added in the fourth quarter, we added just over a million of them. And we did that, as I mentioned earlier at about an $8 CAC. And so if you went back a year that you know, our CAC was in the 20s, and every quarter, we've been able to improve our CAC and kind of keep it at that low level, because of the unique type of funnel that we have. That then translates into a two month payback period. And importantly, we're able to do that at a really strong ARPU, and so our ARPU was at over $60. And again, while we're spending less than $10, to acquire them.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat. So you know, with all these numbers in mind, and noting, especially to your final point, you just made here the trend that these numbers seem to be following and these metrics seem to be following, they appear to be pretty significant for the money line and for the future of your business. And I'm curious about the general circumstances in which these numbers were tallied, you know, you think about the macro climate, the economic circumstances that any business would be facing in most of last year, certainly at the end of last year. I'm curious about how those macro circumstances impacted the financials that you reported and also, you know, how they might impact the way that you go about the future quarters. You know, once we get past the quarters that you were, of course reporting on earlier this week. Tell me a little bit about your perspective and your take on everything that's happening in the macro sense and how it impacts your business?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRick Correia: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, that is a great question. You know, one of the things that's unique about where we are positioned is we have a really interesting window into the American consumer. We also have an interesting window into a lot of the market participants on the enterprise side, right? The kind of big channels where customers are looking for products, as well as those big companies that are delivering those financial products. And so with those windows, where we kind of have a good sense of how the consumer is performing and behaving. And I think what we see right now is they're, they're pretty resilient still. And we're uniquely positioned because of this mix between our consumer and enterprise business. So on the consumer side, we're continuing to see consumers having a lot of demand for financial products and demand for credit. And demand for the kind of higher yield savings that they're seeing, you know, are very different than the type of yield that they receive in their deposit accounts, one, two, three years ago.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd then on the enterprise side, you know, channel partners are still seeing a lot of consumers spending time looking for ways to kind of improve their financial lives. We have seen, you know, some headwinds, from the kind of product providers where just kind of given the raising rate environment, you know, they're having to step back or tighten their risk box, which means it just isn't as much available, as we kind of saw in late Q3 and certainly part of Q4 of ‘22 customers having access to that. And so I think what's been important is having, for us, both a consumer business and an enterprise business allows us to be able to continue to hit our financial targets, because they kind of work as almost a hedge where what we've seen with the consumer side is we're able to kind of drive more and more kind of transaction fees, those type of direct deposit interchange revenue lines, as we kind of saw some headwinds, as I said, with the enterprise side of the business. With that position, just really to your question about what it means for the future, it means that we'll be able to continue to execute and realize the momentum that we've been having. If you look at the overall mix of our business, from an enterprise and consumer perspective, you know, consumer is about 65% of the revenue mix in enterprise is about 35%. And that's a slight shift more towards consumer relative to what we were expecting, you know, six months ago, we thought we'd start trending more and more towards 50-50. But again, that's a benefit for us, as we start to see that the shift or the tailwinds that we see in the consumer side, tend to offset some of the headwinds that we see on the enterprise side.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eTotally and noting, to your point that this could, in some ways, behave as a hedge that you have these two forks in the business. I'm curious about how, you know, it might be what the experience might be building both a consumer and an enterprise part of the business, in what could be construed as, as volatile economic circumstances or a volatile economic environment? Is that a difficulty for MoneyLion? And if so, tell me about how you try to, you know, establish these two business entities or, you know, I don't want to suggest that they're separate entities, but two parts of your business that serve a different customer? Is it difficult to develop both of those and to mature both of those at the same time, knowing that the economic climate is not the most hospitable?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRick Correia: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, another great question, which so, I think fortunately, for us, it's all built. You know, certainly there are always optimizations and improvements that you're doing. But we are, you know, easily the most full featured offering out there from a financial bank perspective that exists. So for some companies that might have a feature as an entire company, we have that embedded, it's just a feature. So for example, like a round ups. And so if you kind of looked at the MoneyLion app, from a consumer perspective, it's fully built, it's the most full featured product that exists out there, we encourage people to download the app and play around with it, it's free, you get access to incredible kinds of content. And then the more that you interact with it, the more personalized it becomes, and the more that we're able to help people\u0026nbsp; access the right mix of financial products. And so, you know, from an enterprise perspective, you know, there are always ways to continue to improve.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo to give people a little more transparency into what that means from an enterprise perspective, we are a network and we're a technology company. What we help our channel partners do is we allowed them to be able to have a very flexible, different ways in which they can basically use our technology, you can kind of have an embedded piece of software, we can host an entire white label type of site for you, you can kind of have a mobile version of it. And that allows our channel partners to kind of optimize the way in which they want to have customer experience to meet their needs. And however, basically, those channel partners are kind of routing customers to us, or people that have high intent to us, on the other side of the equation, are our very fast set of product partners. And again, we have deep integration, and we give them software that allows them to kind of tweak the way in which they want to see customers, the type of customers, they want to see the frequency to help them meet their needs. And so for that perspective, again, that's already all built. Of course, we're always looking at ways to optimize the funnel, we're always looking at ways to add more and more new types of enterprise web services that we can deliver to those partners.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut you know, when we look at the macro environment ahead, and it's incredibly difficult to kind of look forward and think about what that macro can unveil for our business. But we're confident because whichever way the market kind of tilts over the next coming quarters, we're going to either kind of realize our plan, or we're going to be able to take advantage of credit partners and the credit boxes, the risk boxes that will widen back up. And that allows us to kind of further you know, meet that on that demand that we're seeing. It's increasing quarter over quarter from the client side with products that meet their needs. So we think that at a minimum for us, we execute against our plan, we get to EBITDA positive over the year, and with some tailwinds, and with some kind of macro positive news, you know, the kind of back after the year we get to kind of spring load into outperformance.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, makes a ton of sense. And I think this answer specifically speaks to some of MoneyLion’s potential competitive advantages moving into the future. So with that in mind, I would love to just hear your perspective broadly about the future of the FinTech space, what is exciting to you right now?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRick Correia: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI think what's exciting, and we're excited because we kind of play a really unique position within the FinTech space, which is I think, some people try to kind of pigeonhole us into being, you know, a neobank, or patroness into being, you know, a lender or petitioners into being kind of a robo-advisor. We are all of the above. But importantly, we're really just that interface layer to the customer. And so what we are able to do is really kind of play that kind of Swiss role, where we are a data company and a technology company that is able to take our customer and give them access to the right product. And that can be a product from any FinTech provider. So what's exciting about us as there is, more and more FinTech players are entering the space, they're always kind of driving innovation. And we get to take advantage of that by making those products available to our customers, whether it's an insurance, whether it's in mortgages, whether it's an auto refi, even when you start to look at some of the things that are kind of very budget intensive, so travel, spend on a car, things like that, we're even able to give our customers access to those types of, of non financial products through our partners, through our overall Money Lions membership or while membership. So it's a really exciting place to be in a space to be because we hope there are more and more market entrants into the FinTech space, and specifically on the product side so that we can make that available to our customer base.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, and we're certainly excited to watch how FinTech unfolds in the coming months and years. Certainly, it's been a very interesting past couple of weeks. I shouldn't even be that generous – the past couple of days following the FinTech space. So we are going to have to check back, Rick, and see how things pan out for the next couple of months and years. So with that, I want to thank our wonderful guests today, Rick Correia, CFO at MoneyLion for his time. Rick, thank you so much.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRick Correia: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThank you. I look forward to being back next quarter.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOf course. And thank you again to our partners at MoneyLion who made today's show possible. We will be back next month with even more news and updates from the FinTech economy. Thank you so much for listening, and I'll see you next time.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","eventType":"PUBLIC_LIVE","assetCategorization":["EXEC_Q_A"],"sponsorDetailsDto":{"sponsor":{"id":"4AZld8DNW0SHRqXId0wbVmvxC5OfvNaE","name":"MoneyLion","disclosure":"","imageUrl":""},"symbols":["ML"]},"audienceCohort":"ALL_MEMBERS","hosts":[{"publicId":"902e27b4-f7a8-41d1-b4b6-d03c446c5ffa","username":"kinsey","displayName":"Kinsey Grant","profilePictureURL":"https://prod-api.154310543964.hellopublic.com/static/users/images/Sosi4hWQpiDT3ZXndA3KXkEbz0Mpi2fi-thumbnail-300x300.jpg","verified":true,"isPrivate":false,"bio":"host of Thinking Is Cool","followedByMe":false,"following":false},{"publicId":"7236716d-cac0-42e1-b575-98ae067aa0eb","username":"rickcorreia","displayName":"Rick Correia","profilePictureURL":"https://prod-api.154310543964.hellopublic.com/static/users/images/nO9LTaZAkkxhrXlF4tkJcbJlGrUbU3E6-thumbnail-300x300.jpg","verified":false,"isPrivate":false,"bio":"CFO at MoneyLion","followedByMe":false,"following":false}],"stocks":[{"symbol":"ML","name":"MoneyLion"}],"slug":"https://app.public.com/live/stock-market/interview-with-moneylions-cfo","uniqueId":"m2kA8FGqPRsJAnX6dr9Zsm7gV9TLMXOP","status":"PUBLISHED","linkedIds":["nw96ZGLbPoxnVotZydc80nXCMYoY9GUn","XZ6CgnSgEC1SWKGctrmeZ9353WDgj1SL"],"cta":{"buttonText":"Sign up","title":"Interview with MoneyLion's CFO","subtitle":"Invest in stocks, ETFs, cryptos, alts, and more.

","transcript":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Hello, everyone, and good afternoon and welcome to Public Live this Thursday, March 9th. I am your host, Kori Hale and today folks, we're going to be discussing Spotify’s recent Stream On event and be updating you on Metas year of efficiency as well as other big tech news. And I'm excited because this is one of my favorite guests we have on the show with us today. It's Mark Mahaney, senior managing director and head of the internet research team over at Evercore ISI. Mark is also if that wasn't enough, and it is but he is also the author of a new book titled Nothing But Net 10 times stock picking lessons for one of Wall Street's top tech analysts. And of course, right here on Public, we're doing book giveaway. So if you want to get your hands on a copy, just send a DM to the public alive handle. Alright, Mark, welcome back to public life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e It's good to be back, Kori.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e We're always happy to have you join us. And of course, you break down as some of these big tech names on Wall Street, as I mentioned, and we got to talk about Spotify. The streaming platform recently hosted its Stream On event and announced many new features planned for the app. For those of us who maybe did not catch that announcement, could you provide some insight into some of the standout features that were discussed?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMark Mahaney: Okay, I think this was their fifth annual Stream On event. It's kind of their product. It's like their customer event, but it's really kind of a product development event. I guess that's what it is. It's it's like, it's like Apple's worldwide developer conference. Now not nearly as impactful or meaningful as that, but it's just this is where they roll out their latest innovations. So there was some new disclosure to the founder, Daniel Eck, the CEO announced that they are now over half a billion monthly visitors, which means that monthly average users, which means that they're now a little bit ahead of their guidance for the March quarter, it's a small thing for the financial folks out there. Second is they disclose that Spotify recommendations are powering more than half of users streams. And why that matters is you know, the more that Spotify is music, people who listen to Spotify, listen to curated music, rather than just going on there and saying, you know, I want this song by Taylor Swift, the extent to which they kind of give the wheel, give the mic, give the turntable that's the right one, Kori, give the turntable to Spotify and say, play me something interesting. That means that Spotify becomes more influential, and that means that artists then want to pay to kind of influence To that influence, or that they're willing to advertise, you know that that creates more of an opportunity for them, you know, the, the retailer who simply just fulfills, doesn't generate margins as nice as the retailer who actually suggests and can and can influence tastes and patterns and things like that. And then the last thing that I thought was interesting is they have a new home feed that's coming out. And I think it's a little bit what I would call the TikTok isation of Spotify. So you're gonna see more TikTok-like features short-form video kind of right up front, you can see sort of a little bit of endless feed is the wrong word, but you're gonna see some of that you're gonna see more than just the static feed when you start. So these are all going to all these little nuances that sort of improve, they also talked about an AI DJ, I'm not sure we're going to really notice a difference, but we'll try it out. And then a new ad format, that's kind of a small video ad format, anything that generates ad revenue for Spotify is going to be good for their gross margins. So those are the features that came out of Spotify’s Stream On on event yesterday,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Mark, I love that you brought up actually a plethora things that I want to really quickly piggyback off of. And also, we probably have lots of Swifties in our audience, and they probably were like, Mark, we only play Taylor Swift straight through. We don't need any sort of DJ for that. But the interesting thing about what I are what came to my mind was Payola back in the day, which I might be dating myself back in the radio days, when radio was a massive thing, right in artists, more so record labels are paying radio DJs right to play their particular artists. Are you saying then since there's more of this suggesting type of thing that's going to happen with Spotify going forward that there could be some streaming Payola-ish version at some point?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, you're using a very loaded word and Payola and you know, in some senses, that's what it is. But in some senses, maybe we need to rethink it a little bit. So when you use Google search engine, do you think about all those paid ads within Google as Payola? In other words, you know, when when you do a search for, you know, tickets to March Madness games, basketball games, or when you do a search for, you know, Hawaiian, you know, budget, airfare, and you get these paid results in there. I mean, that's essentially I've thought about this as Google's I'm sorry, as Spotify, Googling it search results, you go on there, and you look at today's top country hits, or today's you know, whatever hit it, and hip hop, I think they've got it, they've got something, you know, for a Christian country, I mean, they've got every possible genre you can imagine in there. And if you're an emerging artist, and if you're in a label, you know, this is like, this is a target-rich environment. I mean, these are people listening to your genre, you're a new artist, you know, like to you to here's an opportunity for you to advertise your song so that Italy shows up somewhere in the queue. Now, many people may not listen to your music, but at least here's a chance to market or advertise. And so that's kind of how we think about it. And so I don't know if that answers your question. But that's what that's the exact intent behind Spotify. And what they've done is given labels the ability to market to advertise their newest labels, their newest features, their newest artists, one of the world's largest, most influential music platforms, if you can make it on Spotify, you can make it anywhere. Spotify makes or breaks artists. And then sorry, but that is true, given how they've got half a billion people who listen to the surface, and probably 250 million who listen to it on a daily basis. There's no music listening service outside of YouTube, that's any bigger any more influential than that. And so that's how I think about and I've always thought about it as a great opportunity last year, I think they generate about $200 million in revenue a little bit more than that, from this what is what I call this advertising revenue. I think it's good for Spotify’s business model. And I also do think it creates opportunities for us of the artists that are on Spotify, here's a chance for them to here's a chance for them to promote their work their blood, sweat and toil.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, you know what, Mark that makes me think what else do you think is good for Spotify his business model because right now you're holding a price target of $185 on their stock with an outperform rating. What is it beyond that? The fact that they're getting this half a billion monthly active users that really, you know, has you all over at Evercore ISI so pro Spotify?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, I am pro Spotify. I was pro-Spotify last year Kori I think you remember that. And the stock tanked. I thought we were going to have an inflection point last year we didn't. And I thought I meant that in terms of gross margins. This is why I like Spotify here and I may be wrong again. You know, but I'm trying to get it right this time. So one, we know that the multiple has come down dramatically on this one This thing goat used to go at four or five, six times, he'd be, you know, enterprise value to sales. Now we're sub two times like that's cheaper than Netflix is cheaper than, well, sort of online dating companies which are somewhat similar. I mean, this is a subscription business and an advertising business, although it's mostly a subscription business. So I think it's cheap. I think the estimates have been de-risk. I think the multiple has then been de-risked. They've started taking some cost actions, they probably overbuilt like a lot of tech companies. So they've been taking some cost actions. But why I particularly like the setup this year, is that I think you're finally at a place where you're going to cut back on some of that podcast investment, heavy spending that they've had. So I think you're finally going to get gross margins to move up. For low gross margin businesses. When you see gross margins move up, it's almost always a major catalyst for the stock. Second is they are likely to implement a price increase their biggest competitors, Apple and Amazon have both implemented a price increase. So it gives it kind of raises the umbrella a little bit and allows them to raise prices. Usually, that's a good thing for companies and for and for stocks. And then the third thing is Kori, last year, they had a record number of new users globally they added the number was something like 70 million. And what typically happens with Spotify is people come on as free users. And then over time, they kind of migrate a decent number of migrate over to be paid subscribers. So if the pick of the record MAU growth last year converts into paid subscriber growth, boom, I got my third catalyst for this year. So that's why I like it. I think the thing can recover to sort of like two times EV to sales. I just don't think that's an aggressive multiple. I know we're in a tough market for for growth equities. This year. This is a company that's been consistently free cash flow positive, admittedly a very small, minimal level, but I do like it and I think it's it's the leading way to play music streaming worldwide. So that's why we that's why we're pitching Spotify is one of our top longs this year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e See Mark just because you were wrong last year, that doesn't mean you're wrong. This year. We're not even before three months into the year and Spotify obviously doing pretty well. However, competition this year for Spotify, right also completely ticking up. This is no pun intended specifically with TikTok, right. This is a major competitive threat. Spotify has, you know, acknowledged this, you know, as part of their business model the company is working to obviously expand its streaming globally. TikTok has already said that, do you actually see Tik Tok as a threat to Spotify? Especially with maybe the legal issues by legal I mean regulatory issues around TikTok in the US.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Kori I may be wrong, but I don't think so. I think the bigger competitive risk really is Apple Music. YouTube music, Amazon music. Those are kind of the more direct So, let's see. Yeah, I think I'm not sure the competition is greater. But yes, TikTok has got a, you know, huge audience worldwide. It's one of those things where can the brand really be stretched? Are people going to really think about like, TikTok is a wonderful experience for you know, for consumers. It's just highly entertaining, addictive, maybe, but also truly highly entertaining. But it's a different type of entertainment than music. And I'm in one of the problems that TikTok is apparently having is getting the rights that Spotify spent a lot of time getting from the labels. So I just, I'm not at all sure that TikTok is going to come out and directly compete with, with Spotify. I'll take the other side on that I may be wrong. I worry about the other companies. But I've just noticed in the seven years I've been running surveys on Spotify, every year, they seem to gain more share of ear can I say that, share of ear you know, like their their share of people listening to streaming music on Android devices. And by the way on Apple devices has pretty consistently risen over the last couple of years. So they're doing something right the real issue on the stock and why it hasn't done anything since its IPO is or direct listing is the business model and people want to see the gross margins go up people want to see them start generating substantial amounts of free cash flow they generate minimal amount but let's get chunky. Let's get a lot of free cash flow. I think they can start gapping up that gross margin this year start growing it I think 10 People can start believing again that there can be sizable free cash flow and that could cause the rewriting in the stock to go up this year. That's why I like it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e All right. No, I I'm with you on that Mark. I want to shift really quickly while we have some time though and cover another big tech company which is Facebook's parent company Meta they're entering into their year of efficiency are since entering I guess it's continuing as the social media giant is expected to layoff thousands more or employees as early as this week. Might I also add it is not lost on me that a company that's shifting into a year of efficiency, which is away from the metaverse after they changed the parent company name to Meta is a lot of questions in my mind around that. However, this is the second largest scale cut these layoffs by Meta. How many more can investors expect as part of this year of efficiency?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMark Mahaney:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, I do think it's necessary the year of efficiency. You know, we there's two factors that are going on here. One is that overall demand trends are softening for macro economic reasons. And so layoffs aren't fun. I've gone through them, you know that they're painful for everybody involved, especially if you're one of those people getting laid off. But you know, when times get tough, we all the households tighten their belts and companies need to tighten their belts. And one way you do that, is you unfortunately have to let go some of your employees. The other thing, though, that's one factor. But the other one that Jim maybe just as material and maybe more so is that there clearly are some companies that overbuilt post the COVID crisis, I think Amazon was one I think, Meta was one if you were to go back and look at the revenue growth between 2019 and 2022. And then the OPEX growth, your operating expense growth, you'll see there's a couple of companies that really stick out that they grew their expenses more than their revenue, even though revenue shot up materially between 2019 and 2022, the expenses grew even more. And I think these companies sort of assumed that there was this positive inflection and demand for the services that we kind of continue on for many, many years. That didn't happen. It's not like we've gained, it's not like we've reverted to 2019. It's just that the growth rates have kind of more normalized, rather than just kind of kept it accelerating level. Anyway, all of that is Meta was one of those companies, demand trends are softening for online advertising, no question about it as they are for all marketing spend, and this company over hired, and it's probably the right thing for them to do to take these layoffs. I you know, I think what's been reported recently, I think that is probably going to happen. There's enough there's enough smoke there. There's got to be some hiring fire. I think that's good. I think that actually was a surprisingly good pun. And then I'm going to use that in the note thank you, Kori. And then, but yeah, so I think that's happened. And I think it helps, what investors want to see is defend the bottom line, you know, you can't control what's going to happen to you know, ad marketers, and how much they're going to spend in a recession, you can control your cost basis, and show me that you're going to do that show me your grown-up company. And Zuckerberg kind of weaved and waved a little bit last year. But I think he got to the I think he finally I think most of the signals he gave were it Yes, I'm a mature company, CEO. I'm a CEO, I'm a mature CEO of a company, it may be a mature company. And we need to be much more careful about expenses. And it's not growth at all costs. And when he started to do that, I think he's been rewarded by the market. And I think there's more of that coming. And I also think that the revenue growth trends are going to improve at Facebook because I think they're improving their ad tracking their ad attribution models. And I think they're going to be able to better monetize reels, which I think has turned out to be phenomenally successful for both Instagram and Facebook in terms of new users and more engagement. So I really like Meta here. I think it's still cheap at 14 times earnings. And I think there's 50% upside in the stock. So it's actually my number one pick right now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKori Hale:\u003c/strong\u003e Wow, number one pick. I didn't know that's where you were going with that mark. But that's that's a strong conviction there. Okay. Number one pick, you know what I was thinking to in the broader tech scheme, something I'd love to get your insights on. We don't have time to do it today. So we'll have to have another session. But I really want to pick your brain around chat GPT around Microsoft's login strategy, how you see that playing into revenue. What does that do to Google? Especially because you brought up ads of the like and how that all could really up in certain business revenue lines across different tech companies. I don't know if you've given that any thought but I'd love to hear what you have to say on that next time around. Next time around. All right, everyone. This was a great session. By the way I love this and I we always love when Mark comes on and shares his insights. Once again, everyone this is Mark Mahaney, senior managing director and head of the interset internet research team over at Evercore ISI don't forget about the book giveaway that we're doing DM us and Public Live handle today.

I'm your host Connor Round and I'm so happy to be here with you today to discuss the key themes in AI and the industries that it can bring innovation and growth to. I'm thrilled to welcome my guest today, Ivana Delevska, Founder and Chief Investment Officer at Spear Invest.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThanks for having me, Connor.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor Round: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo just to start off, you know, we're here to talk about artificial intelligence. It's an opportunity that has use cases beyond the human imagination. So just to start off when considering business applications of AI, could you help investors understand what industries and sectors you see greatly benefit from the innovations in the space?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYes, sounds great. Connor so many people under appreciate the fact that AI today is already a $100 billion industry and it's still in the very early innings. The main applications that we see it used in today would be for consumer technologies. So it would be for like recommenders in cases like TikTok or e-commerce where you're getting recommended products to buy. So that's one of the largest applications that we see today. But looking forward, we think AI will be transformational for many industries, traditionally industrials, automotive, life sciences. We think it's really going to have a transformative impact for the broader industrial complex.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eVery interesting. And could you just break down the AI capabilities that you see within the social media space?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWell, yeah, so it's interesting social media. Previously, all of the innovation or all of the use cases in AI were based on this recommender model. So basically, companies like TikTok would in-house train their their models to be able to tell based on few data points on videos that you watch, they're going to be able to form a whole profile about you, and then be able to, to recommend you other videos, and they can be really addictive as most people, most people have seen.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo that's kind of the main use case today. Now, the new thing in AI is this transformer model, which was the concept or the paper was written and introduced in 2016. But you've really seen these models just getting trained, these large language models. So Chat GPT, is one application of this large language model, it's based on a model called GPT 3 that was introduced in 2021. So a lot of people are excited about the applications of Chat GPT today, but I will highlight that this is just one kind of flavor of the opportunity that we see going forward.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat, I'm actually happy you brought up chat GPT that was just gonna go right into that. Apart from it kind of just expanding and, you know, breaking out into the scene very quickly. How do you see other companies reacting in the space? Do you see Google coming out with a new search engine capability? I'd love to hear your opinion on that.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, so we see Microsoft and Google, as potentially being leaders on the language side, Microsoft has maybe a head start, they've invested quite a bit here. And we've seen quite a lot from them. They're behind the GPT 3 language model, but they also recently announced an even newer model with even more parameters, 530 billion parameters, so we're gonna see a lot more from them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGoogle has been pretty quiet. They were maybe the leader several years ago. So we are waiting to hear what's going to come out of them. Investors believe that they have something, but it's kind of TBD. So as of right now, those are the two that are going to be leaders in the lead on the language model side. But it's very important for investors to realize that when you invest, you don't necessarily just want the direct beneficiary over trend, there is going to be a lot of investment in the infrastructure beyond behind like, behind AI. So for Microsoft, it's not just on the Bing side that they can introduce Chat GPT and kind of help jumpstart their business, but they're really going to benefit on the cloud side as well. So from an investment perspective, right now, we're finding better risk rewards in investing in the infrastructure. So it would be semiconductors, cloud infrastructure, and cybersecurity as well. So yeah, so basically, the point here is beware of value traps, right? You don't want to invest in something that will get competed away.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, definitely. And just to keep on Chat GPT, a lot of the hype has brought excitement to firms. And it kind of seems to be a similar trend to that of the crypto boom in 2021, with BuzzFeed announcing Chat GPT similar implications. Just wanted to know, do you see this as maybe a trend that will die down? Or is this something that we can expect to last?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWell ChatGPT specifically, what you will need to see is people building things that are going to be useful on it. So specifically, for us, we're looking for maybe broader opportunities than that. But AI is a trend that is definitely not going to die down. As I mentioned before, it's already a $100 billion dollar industry. So whether Chat GPT takes off or not, it’s not really going to have..it will have some implications on AI but it's not really going to have broad implications for AI, if that makes sense.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eDefinitely and as you said, it is a $100 billion industry already. But in order to rev up innovation in this space further, much hardware and infrastructure will be required, such as the need for, you know, the much reliance semiconductor industry.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhat types of semiconductors, so we could just help investors understand, are required for building out AI, and how much of the industry is dedicated to its face?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYes, so, so thanks for asking that question, Connor. So basically, in order to train these models, you need GPUs. And that's why companies like Nvidia produce these today. And basically GPUs allow computers to do parallel operations and the reason why people are all of a sudden so excited about AI versus say a year or two ago is that prior to the transformer model, and prior to this language, first language models, trained AI will just be able to do prescriptive tasks. So, if you give it a bunch of images, it can learn what you're showing it, right? So it wouldn't necessarily be able to put things into context or draw its own conclusions. So in order to be able to put things into context and draw its own conclusions, the model sizes have increased exponentially. So maybe five years ago, in 2018, the model sizes would have been less than 100 million parameters. Today, these models that are trained and deployed are over over 500 billion parameters. So the amount of GPUs that are required for this is exponential.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat, and what players in the space do you see benefiting from increased demand for AI related chips such as GPUs?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e So in video is gonna be a big beneficiary full disclosure, we all not only video stock, and we disclose all of our holdings on our website, but then you may be able to see the reason why Nvidia is such a beneficiary is because they came up with this CUDA architecture that is free for people to use. So if you want to build something on AI, all you need to do is buy the NVIDIA hardware, and then you can use these frameworks for free. Other companies are not there yet. So you could still buy GPUs from AMD. But then what do you do with them? But over time, as the industry develops, there is likely going to be other solutions, and maybe some of these other companies that are developing GPUs will benefit.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnother area we really like that is not doing very well right now, is cloud infrastructure. So a lot of the cloud names are getting hit pretty hard, because of enterprise spending cuts. So this is a sector that hasn't really done that well in this recent bounce, this year. Nvidia is already up quite a bit here today, but the cloud cloud names have really not performed in line, so we like that. And then as you deploy AI, you're going to have a lot more vulnerabilities so you're going to need newer cybersecurity solutions. So this is another area where we find a lot of opportunities – basically how do you secure? How do you secure these AI workloads? And how do you secure eight edge computing?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat, so a lot of industries that are going to see some upside there and those segments, but the industry has struggled with keeping up with shift demand through supply chain constraints, severely dealing with shortages throughout the years of 2021 and 2022. If AI demand gears up in the near future, will semiconductor firms be able to manage their supply chains to keep up with demand trends?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo we see a lot of supply actually getting added over the next two to three years. So we think there is going to be plenty of supply of chips available. And just to explain how this works, basically companies like Nvidia and AMD, they don't manufacture the chips, but they just design them and then foundries like TSMC will do the actual manufacturing. So we're seeing - this is a pretty big trend actually that's supporting even broader economic activity in the U.S. are these large CapEx investments by the foundries or the large chip manufacturers like TSMC. Intel as well has expansion plans. So there's going to be plenty of supply, we believe to meet the demand.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat And just lastly, could you just break down the traditional segments of the semiconductor space? What spaces or segments do you see slowing down? And are there any other ones that you see an opportunity, and I know that you named a few, but if you just break them down for investors to understand a little bit more, I think that'd be fantastic. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIvana Delevska: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, absolutely. So basically the big separation is between consumer and data center. So, if you look at, for example, TSMC, revenues would be like half consumer, like a very high level, half consumer half data center. So consumer would be used in PCs, smartphones, and then on the data center side, this would be like cloud, cloud vendors, and in any sort of enterprise computing. And then within the data center segment, we're seeing slowdown across the board. So the consumer got pretty hard hit at the beginning of last year, PC demand has been significantly down but the way semis work is usually there is a lot of inventory in the system. So what the manufacturers or designers see is a lot worse than what in demand looks like.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo as inventory stabilizes, TSMC said that they're expecting it to stabilize at the beginning of this year, and to see pick up in the second half of next year. And then similarly, on the data center side, that segment just started seeing some weakness, but we believe that the high performance computing, which is what we talked about with Nvidia, like the chips that are required for AI, we expect those will hold up better.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConnor Round: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGreat.

I'm your host Ann Berry and we are always diving in together to the latest from the world of investing. Today, we are focused on energy transformation and what it means to be an investor in this space. Joining me as our guest today is Yasmine Dayha Bilger who is the head of ETFs at Engine No. 1. Yasmine, welcome to Public Llive.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmin Bilger: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThanks so much for having me.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI would love to jump right in Yasmine and learn more about what Engine No. 1 is focused on besides sounding like a fire station. But perhaps appropriate given the topic? Could you just walk our audience through what you do, who you all are and what it is that you guys are focused on?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmin Bilger: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAbsolutely. And in fact, you are right on the fire station piece. So\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003epretty good image. But absolutely. So number one is an investment firm that is focused on identifying and investing around what we believe are large scale transformational investment themes. We're a firm founded by former hedge fund and private market investors and have a background in deep fundamental analysis. We launched a little over two years ago, and I think are probably best known for our activist campaign in which we successfully placed three people on the board of directors at ExxonMobil.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd I think, actually, the campaign was quite interesting, because it reflects, I think, two things that really sit across the entire firm, really pillars of what we do. The first is that we were able to do that while only owning five basis points of the company. Well, the reason we were able to was because we focused all of our arguments and recommendations on why they were additive to long term shareholder value, which allowed I think other investors to vote alongside of us. And I think what it shows is, if you've grabbed your thinking in economics, you can accomplish quite a lot in the public markets.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe second that I think is kind of reflective of what we do is that we're an engagement focused company. And usually in the space of climate, the mantra is, if you don't like it, you don't own it. So most climate strategies don't own the largest emitting sectors, the largest emitting companies – we very much own and deeply engage.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd so just to sort of unpack that a little bit more, first of all, as an activist with less than five basis points of ownership to to effect that change, Yasmin, it really brings to life what you say by actively engaging.\u003c/span\u003eLet's talk a little bit more into the work that Engine No. 1 is doing specifically on the topic of energy transformation. It's a really buzzy topic, everyone's talking about it. I'm just back from Davos, Yasmin, where climate and energy transformation was just a huge focus area. Help us cut through the jargon. What does energy transformation really mean, in your context?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmin Bilger:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Yeah, absolutely. So there are a number of reasons why we see a significant move towards decarbonization across our energy systems. Now, with that said, I think it's really important to note that we, as many other people believe that we continue to have a real near term need for fossil fuels. So that's really the transformation we're talking about. It's not a light switch. And I'd also say a lot of people talk about this as the energy transition. And there's so many terms that goes around. To us, that sort of implies a one to one move from traditional fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources. But this is much more about truly a transformation of our entire energy system, and will take decades to play out.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd you did mention it's an enormous investment opportunity. By some estimates, it will require somewhere between $3-5 trillion of investment per year to meet Net Zero targets. So the opportunity creates a lot of investment opportunities, in fact, and they're not just in one sector, when people traditionally think about the energy sector. They really do span our entire economy. I will say I think the opportunity in my opinion is a little misunderstood. I think as I mentioned, the traditional thinking and climate is if you don't like it, you don't own it. So what does that really mean?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMost people tackling climate from an investment perspective, almost definitively have no exposure to traditional oil and gas companies, for example, are basically not exposed at all to the largest sources and uses of energy. We flip the entire conversation of this theme on its head. But just as a set stat to give this to life to people, nearly 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions just come from three segments of our economy, energy, agriculture and transportation, that is the heart of the energy transition. And in our opinion, to drive that sort of decarbonisation at scale, you really need to go where the emissions are. And I think it's the transformation of these various systems that we'll see both, you know, a meaningful reduction in carbon emissions, but also huge investment opportunities for people looking to take advantage of some of the dollars that are being put to work in these spaces.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo just to really drill into that, Yasmine, to make sure that there's no ambiguity here. So the ETF that you have, together at Engine No. 1 one does or does not include the stocks of what we people might think of as the more traditional carbon focused energy production companies.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmine Bilger: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNo, we absolutely do our energy\u0026nbsp; transition focus strategy. Net Z absolutely has exposure to the companies that we believe are leading and benefiting from the transformation, which include companies exactly in those segments. I mean, if you think about it, if three-quarters of emissions are coming from the systems themselves, the leaders and incumbents as well as the enablers within these systems will be the companies that actually should benefit most from it. And so we do actually own traditional oil and gas companies, we own auto companies, we own agriculture companies. Now with all that said, these are the companies that are making the investments and have the I'd call it a short, medium and long term strategies to think about how they win in a world with lower carbon emissions. So they're absolutely focusing on the theme. But I think there's a lot of misunderstanding about where the opportunity lies from a company perspective.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThat's a really interesting clarifying point, Yasmine, because I do think that there is this bias or this general perception that when you see instruments out there focused on energy transformation, they tend to exclude some of those traditional players. And just, you know, as an observation that we've seen, you know, in our discussions on public life, a lot of these energy, traditional energy stocks have done quite well, performance wise recently. So it's so interesting that you guys are not shying away from those rather, instead, including those.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYou've been very enthusiastic and emphatic about the fact that energy transformation, as you've defined it, is positioned to be an impactful opportunity and it's going to touch a myriad of industries. You talked about the three largest, can you just unpack for us a little bit more? It was transportation, agriculture, and energy as the biggest pockets of opportunity. But within that, where are you seeing key trends?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmine Bilger: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAbsolutely. So maybe I'll say two things up front. In order to best take advantage of this opportunity, I have two beliefs. One, I think this is absolutely the space for active investment. I think you need to manage your hunting for the best opportunities across this value chain. Secondly, I think you need to be thinking broadly about the opportunity beyond just one sector, you need to be looking at the largest producers and consumers of energy and thinking about how these systems evolve. So maybe two examples to bring that to life. Transportation is a huge source of emissions. Now, most investors when they think about the opportunity and transfer, transportation are really thinking about the move to electric vehicles, and are solely focused on the automakers as they make a push to electrify their car fleet. Now, that is absolutely part of the opportunity.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eHowever, the real broader investment opportunity is much, much wider than that. You also need to think about the elements that are required to accomplish that electrification. So with that broader view, you would be looking at spaces like the metals and inputs that are required to produce batteries such as Lithium, for example. You would be thinking about the companies that are required to extract those metal metals, like mining equipment companies. You would also be thinking about the transportation of those inputs to battery plants, so you know what companies would benefit from this change in transportation. And I think the broader framing is much wider in that we play across that ecosystem and are sort of looking on a short, medium and long term basis for where we think the best opportunities lie.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnother area maybe to highlight would be in agriculture. I think one of the interesting areas within agriculture is just precision agriculture. This is really about giving technology to farmers to be more precise and efficient in their usage of fertilizer and other chemical inputs in the farming process, which is one of the largest sources of emissions and farming. So the companies that are leading in this space are not only helping to reduce emissions by increasing efficiency and how we use these chemicals, but they're also saving farmers and therefore their customers on input costs. So this is a really interesting example of almost what you think of as a win win win. It's good for the company playing in this space, because it should lead to increased market share. It's good for farmers, and it's obviously good for the environment if we're being more precise and how we use these inputs.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLet's talk Yasmine, a little bit too, about the engagement work and sort of go full circle, you know, you opened with what you've done in effectuating change at ExxonMobile., What is your approach to working with companies? What's your process? What's your ideation process to then how you engage with the company to then how you affect change?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmine Bilger: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, it really comes down to taking all of this with an investment foot view. So we're an engagement focus firm. What does that mean? That means in our opinion, whether you own one share, or you own an entire company, you're an owner. Now, most engagement that happens in the asset management community, in my opinion, is really coming from the perspective of quantity, talking to as many companies as possible about as many issue areas.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd you see that, for example, and a lot of stewardship reports that come out at the end of the year from asset managers who say, you know, we talked to 25% more companies this year, therefore, we had more engagement. We take a very different approach, we go very deep and very focused, and we're working directly with the companies that we think are really impactful in the spaces that we operate in. So for example, in the energy transition space, what meets the bar for engagement? Well, first, it's deep fundamental work. We're trying to understand where some of these areas around decarbonization link to an unlocking of value. And secondly, it's about, you know, really working closely with the C suite of many of these companies to help them think about affecting their strategy.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI think the goals can be really wide ranging on one end, it's simply accountability. You know, these are hard strategies to execute for public companies that are focused on quarterly earnings, where these are much longer term strategies in nature. But there's also an acceleration component. Many of the parts of this transition really involve impediments and bottlenecks to the strategic plan. So we sit across the entire ecosystem, and I think can offer some valuable perspective on how best to achieve these long term goals.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThen there's transformation, you know, companies that are not on the right path, we think, to maximize shareholder value in a world that's decarbonizing and so there's, there's really opportunities there, too, that maybe worth highlighting to bring it to life. Maybe just to play on some of the spaces we talked about. We've actually been working really closely with a number of the executives at large automakers as they think about how to reach their EV goals, given the challenges around creating batteries. And so helping them think through how to source the input parts and how to sort of think about their overall approach to battery plants, and then how to execute on the long term goal of electrifying their fleet.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe second was really building upon what we've done in oil and gas, which is we've worked with several large oil and gas companies on helping them to measure and ultimately reduce their methane emissions. Most people don't know this, but methane is something like 80 times more potent than CO2, and so has a really meaningful impact when you reduce it. But in all of these cases, since our Exxon engagement, they have all been very collaborative. I think many management companies really welcome the engagement and I think really appreciate the approach we take, which is really focused on how to think about this from a shareholder value lens.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYasmine, this is a question coming a little out of left field, but it really is on this topic of engagement and how retail investors can do that. You know, I go to my mailbox, and I often you know, I get shareholder vote, correspondence where I hold stocks, what can the average retail investor do? And to your point who doesn't have the kind of huge holdings where you typically see more engagement? What can they do to have their voice heard with these kinds of companies?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmine Bilger:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e I love this question, because to me, this is one of the most interesting trends happening in investment management. The reality is that our whole public market system is centered around the shareholder. Now, as an individual investor, you own a very small piece, but actually, collectively, individual investors own a tremendous amount of the public markets. In fact, the three largest passive firms in the world own about 20 to 25% of the average S\u0026amp;P 500 company, and who are their beneficial holders? Well as individual investors, in many cases.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhat I think the first thing to do is actually understand the system altogether, there's 10s of 1000s of votes that come up that public companies, and I'd say about 500 of them are actually focused in areas around the environment, social issues, governance issues, issues that may be really important to you as an investor. And I think it's really first and foremost understanding that. Secondarily, it's understanding how your manager’s voting, you know, you get to pick and choose where you put your money. And I think now there's certainly more choice in the space around managers who may have a\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003edifferent approach to how they support or not support certain proposals that come up for vote at companies. These are happening every year - so I do think a little bit more of knowledge is power. And I think this is actually going to be a really important trend for the next coming years, as retail investors understand that they actually collectively do own a lot of the largest companies in America.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIt's exciting, it's exciting to hear that there's a way to do these things. And then just last question Yasmine, which is, you know, supply chain strategy. We saw so much disruption, I know, that's something that you had Engine No. 1, have filed as a thematic to do something so just closing thoughts and a little more about that.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYasmine Bilger:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Yeah, we're very excited about this one. This also fits into the bucket of the types of themes we invest in, which are really all about themes that are, you know, long duration and nature, large scale and their size, and I think maybe not perfectly are really understood by the markets. If you think about supply chains, where we're going really has to do with where we've been, which is for the last, you know, let's call it 40 years, companies have been really focused almost exclusively on one thing in their supply chains, which is minimizing cost. And as a result of that, they've moved large portions of their supply chain overseas to lower cost regions, and in many cases, you know, eliminated redundancies and supply chains.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNow, what has this done, this has made supply chains more fragile, it's meant that companies are unable to meet supply spikes, and to really be responsive to demand in fact. And so what are we seeing, we're seeing a huge move to re-localizations of supply chains, which has wide reaching implications. This will have investment implications across spaces like manufacturing, automation and innovation, as we think about some of the types of things that are coming back to the U.S. and places like transportation as we think about disrupting how we move goods. And also probably means more jobs in the U.S, so this is a theme we're very excited about. It's actually in our opinion, linked very closely to the idea of the energy transformation, they sort of go hand in hand and this is another kind of example of where we see a pretty pretty big investment opportunity that lies in front of us. In fact, just to put some numbers on it for folks, during COVID companies lost something like $3.5 trillion dollars because of their supply chain disruptions, so this is a conversation truly about economics.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWhat conversation that was, Yasmine - just incredible to have you on.

Happy Wednesday and welcome once again to Views from Space where we dive into the space economy and where it's headed. This is part of a monthly series presented by Terran Orbital, a manufacturer of small satellites.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI'm your host Kinsey Grant, and I am so excited to dive into our topics today, as the live title will suggest we have some big ones coming up Deep Space, Mars, Milani, all sorts of great new tech that we're going to be talking about today with our fantastic guests who I'm going to introduce right now. We have Margarita Cardi who is the VP of Programs at Tyvak International, which is the International segment of Terran Orbital, and also with us Franco Perez Lissi, the systems engineer at the European Space Agency. Franco, Margherita, welcome to Public Live. I'm so excited to have you here with us today. How are you doing?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFranco Perez Lissi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGood afternoon. All good. How are you doing?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMargherita Cardi\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e: Hi, everybody - Margherita here.\u0026nbsp; Thanks for the invite and it’s evening here but good afternoon to you guys.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, isn't that funny how that works. I'm actually in Los Angeles right now so it's morning here, evening there but you know what? Space – there’s never a bad time to talk about it. So let's dive in. Are you guys ready to get to some big questions today?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMargherita Cardi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAbsolutely.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFranco Perez Lissi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, let's go. Right.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAll right, great. So I want to start here, with getting a better understanding of what we're going to talk about today, setting the groundwork, and understanding the important context. Space as a topic is I would say often rife with a lot of mystique and, and a lot of fascination that goes along with that. Now in your work developing small satellites Margherita, you are working to make space more accessible and especially when we're talking about making space more accessible, we're talking about deep space.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo for our listeners, knowing that this is part of space that's well beyond the Earth's atmosphere, with an emphasis on the area beyond the Earth Moon system, I would love it if you could just walk our audience through a quick rundown of what you think makes deep space so appealing. And I think appealing in a lot of ways, you know, appealing from just a general interest standpoint, but also appealing as a satellite developer or for a scientific researcher, what makes deep space so interesting to you, Margherita?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMargherita Cardi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, thanks for the question. It is a very nice one. And I have to say that, at the moment, let's say, we are pretty, you know, conscious about the Earth orbit so the Leo and the orbit around Earth, are environments that are quite well known, I would say, at this moment, while the deep space environment is kind of unexplored, or, let's say less explored, this makes this you know, fascinating for the human being in general. And, and of course, the other aspect that I love about this environment is that we are targeting, you know, bodies, planets, asteroids, on whatever that are not really known in terms of structure and also visual impact.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo the fact is that even if we have some very good assets on the ground that can, you know, do amazing pictures and amazing inspection of some bodies, just when you just get close to that you can really understand what it looks like, in reality. And so this is something that is really fascinating for me personally, but I think that is the driver, you know, for all the people working in the space environment and targeting, you know, the deep space. So there's a, you know, very far away environment with bodies that we really don't don't know yet. And so even in our mission, which we will go to dive a little bit in detail, we are going to a body that we don't really know about, right? So that's the mystery of discovering something new and, and we don't know what to expect. So with that there is like the mystery of that which is driving our, our work and our let's say the way to do satellites to explore this kind of environment.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah. Yeah. Really interesting. And I think that your focus here on trying to know the unknown is certainly going to be a recurring theme that I'm sure we encounter today as we talk Talk about deep space. Franco, I'm curious if you have anything to add about why you think deep space is so interesting and so attractive and intriguing for both people who are just interested in space and also for the Science and Technology communities?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFranco Perez Lissi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, sure. So thanks very much. Similar to Margherita, I think I had always the interest and ambition to go beyond Earth since we know little about it, which makes it more appealing. And I think the amount of science and technology demonstration potential on this planetary bodies is very large. So we're going beyond Earth, in many cases to study planets or objects of our solar system that could also explain the origin of our universe, and that's making it super cool.\u0026nbsp; I mean, by investigating Mars, we can extract information about how the Earth was or how it will be millions of years. So for instance, we studied the core of asteroids as the one things we’re going to do on our mission, and we could understand the millions of millions of years of history before our universe. So for the mission that we're working on, we're going into deep space with a different objective, we're going there to support the protection of our Earth in case of a closer encounter with a potentially dangerous asteroid. So in this situation, hypothetical by now, we need to deviate the trajectory of an asteroid way before it arrives, two years before. We need to go as far as possible to avoid collision with earth and study these bodies in detail, of course, to get all the tools required. So for me there are planetary defense technology, and scientific interests ongoing. So it's a little bit of a combination.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, that's really interesting to consider how understanding our past and our origins might help us to be better equipped to handle whatever comes in the future. I find that to just be endlessly fascinating. Now, with both of these answers in mind, I would love it if the two of you could explain a little bit how satellites come into play here.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo what are some of the use cases for satellites navigating deep space? And I think this would be a great time to talk about some of the focus areas that both of you have and the work that you're doing within the satellite ecosystem. So tell me a little bit about how satellites play into our strategy for exploring deep space – and both of you can feel free to chime in here and share whatever comes to mind.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMargherita, would you like to kick us off?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMargherita: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYes, sure. So coming to the, let's say, the technology area, of course, as I was saying before\u0026nbsp; the space is kind of a different environment with respect to the Earth orbits, and there are a few things that I would like to stress and to focus on a little bit because these environmental impacts on the design of the spacecraft for a few things, which are crucial. So for the first place, I would say that the radiation environment is different. So let's say in the, in the Deep Space, and in general, out of the atmosphere, there is a radiative environment, which is very peculiar, and it's different with respect to you know, the distance from Earth and from the sun, etc. And so, in the Milan emission, for example, and in the asteroid environment, we have a very peculiar environment, and we have to make sure that our technology, and our systems are able to survive this kind of environment. So, of course, there are some methods in order to ensure that and we are executing an extensive edition campaign on some of the crucial modules of the spacecraft so that we can, you know, try to reproduce on Earth what we will be seeing during the mission. It's not, let's say possible to have a match one to one, but in general, we can have some models that allow us to replicate the environment.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd so, thanks to this test, we are able to understand how the systems are responding to the relative environment and so, to be able to implement any mitigation action that we can actually implement on ground before the mission. So, I would say that ideation is one of the main topics that we are focusing on on Milani as well as the navigation because again, we are not in the Earth orbit. So we cannot rely on, you know, existing assets such as the GPS, for example. So, we have to rely on different methods of navigation with which combined to the distance from the Earth. It makes the world aggregation approach pretty peculiar and complex, I would say. So, we have to implement systems that allow us to navigate in such a far and unknown environment and this is kind of something that is putting challenges in our development.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd in this particular mission, in addition to that, the results are another constraint that We have to consider is that the Milani satellite that we are developing as part of the head of mission will not have the capability to directly communicate with Earth. So, we have to rely on the Hara mothercraft for the communication. So, there is a so-called inter-satellite link system that is allowing Milani and Hara to communicate. And then Hara will be, you know, the main bridge to Earth to download the data and the scientific measurements. So, I would say these three things, at least from the Milani point of view, and then we will see what Frank was saying about the overall mission. But these three challenges are the ones that at the moment are really, you know, adding challenges and pushing the development to a more extreme, let's say level, I would say.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight, right. I imagine that that tremendously complicates things. And I would love to dig in a little bit more to this Milani mission, the Milani CubeSat mission. Franco, if you don't mind, could you tell us a little bit about the purpose of the mission? What are the scientific objectives for the Milani mission?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFranco Perez Lissi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, for sure. So, the main scientific objectives of the mission are mainly related to characterize the binary asteroid surface of Deimos, you see now a hyperspectral camera on board a CubeSat. So, the size objectives are split in three. So, the first one is to map the composition of the Deimos, just to understand, which is the content inside the asteroid to be able to respond. As I said before, if an asteroid is coming to the earth, we need to hit it, we need to change the trajectory. So we need to understand first, the materials and what we're finding when we get there, that is determining the mineral composition difference between the two objects.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI mentioned that this is a binary asteroid, a binary means that probably there is a main body and then there is a small asteroid orbiting around the main body as a moon. So we need to determine if there are differences in mineral composition. And also determine the surface roughness and regolith grain size, what we call the surface made out of boulders, it's compact material, etc. So that will give us a good understanding of how strong we need to hit the Astro, for instance, to change the trajectory, and so on.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo mainly you are familiar with the dark mission that our mission was a NASA mission that was launched a few months ago, and also a few months ago, it impacted the moon. So this mission was demonstrating the first step of the whole space safety program, which was hitting the asteroid and now characterizing what is the aftermath of this technology, right? So this is when Milani will come into play. So basically Milani, once we arrive with the main spacecraft, Milani will be deployed in the asteroid vicinity, we will be flying around the asteroid and take your images in different spectral ranges to understand all these objectives that we mentioned before.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, it really is fascinating stuff and I appreciate all the context here and explaining the, you know, real world real life use cases for all this that’s happening. I know that for a lot of people out there, myself included, it can be difficult to completely understand the scope of some of these projects that are happening in deep space. So I appreciate the attention to detail and helping me understand them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNow, I would love to transition here for a minute to talk about the big picture relationships that make all this happen. We were talking here about the Milani mission, this is a collaboration between your two organizations. And I understand that for much of our modern history, when it comes to space exploration, we hear about competing ambitions from different nations, you know, it's one nation trying to beat another to a certain space milestone. But I understand now that it comes down to a lot more collaboration than that when we're talking about real space exploration and real, you know, major innovation in space, in deep space. So tell me a little bit about how that has worked, you know, this collaboration between Tyvak and with the ESA, tell me how these relationships have evolved to be a little bit more global, as we tried to navigate what comes next and what we need to do next when it pertains to deep space?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMargherita Cardi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSure, I can start answering the question, if you don't mind. So, from my perspective, I have to say that I need to take a little step back in the sense that in Europe, let's say in the last, I would say 10 or 20 years, I'd say that the space environment has been evolving a lot. So historically, there were you know, big space companies, which were you know, getting the majority of the industry at the end on the market and say in the last decades, these small companies, let's say small space companies started to grow, and to have the place, you know, in Europe and and now we can demonstrate that also the medium company as we are, can really do a lot of things for the Europe and for the European Space Agency in general. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe example of Tyvak International is pretty useful to understand this trend, because we were born in 2016 and we were just, you know, three or four employees and now we count 50 people and we grew organically in the European ecosystem I would say of companies, and all our employees are from Europe. Actually, most of them are Italian at the end. And our supply chain is mostly European and Italian. And so we are actually bringing value to the European ecosystem. And, this program demonstrates that, you know, small companies as we are can act as prime contractors. So for Milani, we act as the prime contractor for the European Space Agency, and so we had this amazing opportunity three years ago to start this very challenging project and for which I will never stop to thank ESA for this opportunity because now this is possible.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd it's happening more and more in different projects and, of course, Italy, as always plays a good role, because of course, we have one of the main contributors to the space ecosystem in Europe. And again, working on this program and on other programs that we did in the past it’s challenging and it’s of course having a, you know, a very demanding customer. But I also found in the ESA team, you know, very pragmatic people very prepared, and so the collaboration between the two teams is amazing for this project in particular, I will never stop saying that, you know, the relationship and the collaboration and the pragmatic approach, when everything happens is is really is really awesome. I would say I have never seen something like that before and I'm pretty grateful for that, in this occasion. So that gives me the opportunity to thank again, ESA for that and saying that as my example, I mean, our example as a small company in Italy, working on these small satellites, you know, we demonstrated that we can do more, and we will be growing in the in the future, let's say.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, very, very interesting to hear that. And I think that you know, Margherita, it's very obvious and hearing that answer that collaboration is an enormous part of what both of your companies are doing or both of your organizations are doing. So I appreciate you sharing that. Now finally, to close out today, we'd like to do a little myth busting to talk about some of the biggest myths or misconceptions about space.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd today we'll talk about Deep Space, particularly, but I'd love to ask both of you. Do you have any misconceptions about the space industry that you want to reset the narrative or set the record straight? Anything that you think people get wrong about space that you would like to set them right off? Franco, would love to kick off here with you anything you want.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFranco Perez Lissi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWell, so I'm not sure if it misconceptions, but I think probably there are many aspects of Space Science or space technology that people tend to underestimate because probably they don't understand how complex they are. And I would like to focus on two probably two aspects. So the first one is the space environment. So Margherita was mentioning it before a little bit, but within the low earth orbit, when we are close to the Earth, we are protected by the magnetosphere which protects the Earth from high energy particles. Therefore the environment is more, let's say, adequate for satellites. But when we go beyond, and also that applies also for human spaceflight, so when when astronauts go beyond, things are starting to get a little bit more complex because we don't have that protection of the earth Magnetosphere, and we start interacting with particles that can hit our electronics, deposit a lot of energy and create like break the electronics or create overcurrent over voltages etc. So there is a large complexity in designing and mission that goes beyond, not only because we're going far from the earth and the communications are harder and so on, but also because of the environment.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd the second topic that I would like to also highlight is people usually tend to underestimate the complexity of how hard it is to navigate in space. So we don't have GPS or we don't have our iPhones or Android phones with Google Maps there. But what we have is the stars, and we have the knowledge of our position in the universe so that what we call G and C is guidance, navigation and control of the spacecraft is one of the most complex disciplines. And it's amazing how we can actually help the NASA Dark mission there. So basically, we launch a rocket from the earth, and we can hit an object with an accuracy that is amazing. And that object is probably 200 Million (kilometers) away from Earth.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo that is something that I think people tend to underestimate and how complex it is to hit that target from 200 million kilometers away. So these two aspects for me are things that usually I get questions about. And I think Tyvak is doing an amazing job on both domains, so on the radiation on the environment, etc, designing a robust mission, but also on the guidance and navigation and control to navigate the cube sat around around the authoring system.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, absolutely and I appreciate you sharing that. Margherita, anything you would like to add here?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMargherita Cardi: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMaybe just a couple of more generic points, of course, I fully agree with what Franco said. And maybe something that also people tend to not really fully understand because they are not working on them on this domain is that, you know, space is useless, and there are a lot of problems on the earth so we are wasting money and time working on space missions. And, you know, this is this is, this is a common feeling for people that are not working on the domain. And I would say that, you know, that's not fully true. And in the sense that working on the space, as demonstrating to have a social return, you know, of investment and competencies and knowledge also for on more ground application, I would say.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo based on the different domains and applications, this is kind of something that is now demonstrated. So this is one of the topics that I encounter more and more when I deal with this kind of discussion, having dinner with friends that are not doing this job. And so this is one of the things that I keep stressing with these people that are more external to the space environment, and also that the space, you know, it's accessible to very few people. And it's something that is, again, not accessible. And, again, we spoke about that at the beginning of this half- hour together. But we demonstrated that this is not true anymore. And small satellites, more launchers have opened a big door to space to basically everyone. So I appreciate it's like a complex domain. But you know, the doors now are open to everybody. And so this was not like that 10s of years ago, but now, with the new space economy, this is starting to be a reality. And so everybody can really access space, if they want. So I will say these two topics are our most of the discussion that I have with, you know, people that are not working in this domain.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKinsey Grant:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003e Yeah, I appreciate that context, too. And I think that one of the big lessons or takeaways here that I've had from this conversation is understanding that so much of what is going on in deep space really can have implications and impacts on the way that we go about living here on Earth, and I think that that's really, really interesting.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo with that, I would love to thank both of you, Margherita and Franco for joining us today.

I'm your host Ann Berry. Last year in 2022 only 71 companies IPO’d or went public, much lower a comparison with the 2021 surge of new listings. Since IPOs tend to represent a growth investing opportunity and untested companies, market optimism can play a big role in how IPOs are timed and ultimately received by the market.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eFollowing the optimism of 2021 and the volatility of 2022, let's unpack what experts predict could be in store for the IPO market or Initial Public Offering market in 2023. Our guest today is Nick Einhorn the Vice President of Research at Renaissance Capital, which issues the dollar IPO ETF, the only ETF focusing exclusively on the U.S. IPO market. It does so by providing investors with access to U.S. listed newly public company stocks in one security. Nick, welcome to Public Live.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThanks. Thanks for having me.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNick, great to have you. Let's jump right on in and just unpack some of the stats together. Last year 2022 had a historically low rate of IPOs, so 71, to be exact. And with anything, but especially when it comes to investing, context is key. So I'd love it if you could walk us in the community through some of the challenges that companies were seeing in 2022 and what changed relative to that peaky period of 2021.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRight, so as you say, a lot depends on what happened in 2020, 2021. Really the surge we saw in the markets, but especially in high growth tech stocks, for example, other riskier stocks, riskier assets, how much excitement there was around those and those years, and that drove a lot of the boom of 2021 IPO issuance. We had almost 400 U.S. IPOs, which is the highest it's been since the internet bubble 2000. And then really, things have flipped or flipped around in 2022. Largely because performance started to drop off towards the end of 2022..or sorry, towards the end of 2021 for those high multiple stocks. A lot of the sectors that had surged during 2021 started to turn around, and really started falling throughout all of 2022 and some of that was fears about recessions, the Fed raising interest rates, the war in Ukraine certainly contributed.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd so there's kind of a perfect storm of stocks starting to fall. And the new issues that did come out in 2022 didn't perform well, and so that caused investors to lose interest in the IPO market or stay on the sidelines. And so, at the same time, companies were hesitant to come public in that kind of environment, so a lot of them put their plans on hold, and ended up sitting out the year. So that kind of really just led to, like you said, only around 70 IPOs, which is the lowest number we've seen in the 30 years we've been tracking the IPO market in the U.S.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd you use that dreaded word bubble right to describe some of 2021 and some of the going public activity then. But when we look in 2022 and the companies that did make it out into the public market, were there any things that those companies had in common? Where were they from specific sectors or stages of maturity, or specific industries? Was there something that enabled those that did go public to make it through the process?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, a lot of them were more mature companies, so less risky than your typical IPO. For example, we saw some large spin offs. Corebridge, which was the spin off of the insurance company AIG, Mobileye, a spinoff from Intel, so businesses that were well known by investors already from being part of large public companies. So that was one area, we saw some strength in specific sectors like energy. Given that energy prices were strong last year, we did see a few energy IPOs come out.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWe continue to see biotech issuance just because those are companies that really are more than most companies, need the cash from an IPO to fund drug development. So some of those may have preferred to wait too, for a better environment that you needed the cash to fund their trials. And, yeah, where we really saw the biggest drop off was in, you know, traditional VC backed tech, internet companies, software companies, and then some of the large LBOs. I think we saw no private equity backed IPOs last year, which was a fairly astounding fact.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWe kind of saw the opposite,,some take privates, right, because instead of taking public companies private instead.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, definitely. I mean, you know, those private equity investors will look to where the sentiment is. And it saw last year, certainly later in the year, especially as a buying opportunity, given all the stocks that had been had come down a lot in price. And so, you know, I'm sure they're hoping that they're going to start seeing improvement in the market soon as they can take those public again.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNick, it's so great to have some of the context that you've provided. Let's shift now to how you and your colleagues at Renaissance Capital are thinking about what's ahead for the IPO market this year in 2023. Do you think we're going to see a flat year relative to 2022? Up, down directionally where are you thinking we're heading?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSo our view is that obviously a lot will depend on what happens in the broader markets. But our basic expectation is that things will improve from 2022. But it will be gradual over the course of the year. And we won't get back to kind of normal levels of issuance until late in the year. Certainly, if not, you know, and maybe not even until next year, but we're hoping kind of later this year. And a lot is going to depend again, if the, you know, we want to see the broader market stabilizing, hopefully, the recession fears cool a bit. And we do see kind of a little more, some of the investor confidence come back into some of the sectors that have been the most hurt during the downturn.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBut one thing we've learned from historical study of the IPO market is that periods of slow issuance often tends to produce strong IPO returns. A little counterintuitively, but it's really just because in the slow periods, buyers have a lot of the same power. So, they can really set the price on new issuance and make sure that IPOs are coming out at attractive valuations with clean governance structures, the companies kind of need to give those incentives to buyers to appeal to them. So hopefully, that when we come, these come public, the returns are good. And that, you know, increases interest in the market from both issuers and investors.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd I think we did start to see a little bit of that in the last few months, for example, Mobileye, the Intel spinoff, came public late last year, traded quite well up 40% or so right now. We saw a small insurance company come public last week, that's up over 20%, I believe. So I think we're starting to see some of those green shoots. And I think it will kind of gradually happened over the course of this year that we'll see more of those.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOne of the things that we saw Nick, and you opened with this was the death of the going public and the real harm, in terms of the reduction in the share prices of a lot of businesses, particularly in that tech and growth area, which did not have profitability. And we're projected to burn cash for quite a long time. Do you think there'll be appetite for those types of companies to go public this year?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eI think it will depend on the company. Certainly, I think we've seen a lot of those private companies have shifted their mindset from kind of growth at all costs, which may have been in 2020, 2021. So more of a focus on how do we get to profitability, or at least, you know, break even. I think for the right story, investors will be willing to consider companies with losses, but I think it's going to need to be a kind of compelling story. And then, I think kind of bigger than that is just a question about valuation. Because companies that did private rounds, you know, in the last several years, often did those at very high valuations. And so if they're trying to come public today, that valuation might not be available in the market anymore. And so they have to kind of decide, do they want to wait and hope that they can, you know, grow some more and that the market will improve? Or do they want to bite the bullet and just recognize that, you know, there's no sense in waiting forever, and that if you can come public at a multibillion dollar valuation, it's still, you know, there's still a benefit to that, even if it's not quite what you're looking for.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd so I think we have seen some of the private companies have taken those steps to reset expectations, for example, Instacart lowered its internal valuation several times last year, I think, from around 40 billion to in the 10 billion range. So they're clearly looking at, you know, the reality on the ground and saying, if we're going to if we're going to come public, that's going to be the valuation we're going to be able to get in this market.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eInstacart is one specific example. Nick, thanks for taking us there. Because I'd love to just go through with you a couple of other specific companies that might go public this year. Some that are rumored to be planning IPOs are also Stripe, Discord, Reddit, TikTok coming out of Bytedance, the parent company, Epic Games. Of these maybe others, are there any that you think are potentially more likely to IPO a better position to do so than others?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eYeah, that's always hard to say with specific companies. I do think that some of these have been rumored IPOs for a while now. And part of my feeling is that if they didn't want to come public in 2021, when the market was super hot, you know, I'm not convinced they're gonna want to come this year. But I think some of these might be certainly IPO candidates. I'm sure they're watching the markets and eyeing the environment. But there are a lot of names that we track and I think some of them, like Instacart, like I mentioned, is one that we think is decently likely to come this year.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThere's some specific areas like there's a few big semiconductor companies that have been talking about IPOs and that's been an interesting area for investors in recent years. Cybersecurity is an area that I think has gotten a lot of attention lately. And there are some candidates in there like Arctic Wolf Networks, Lacework, Net Scope. So those are some names that I think, you know, could be coming. We have had a few big filings in recent months, for example, Kenvue which is a Johnson \u0026amp; Johnson spin off of consumer products.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eOverall, there's just a lot of companies that are going to be monitoring the situation, and as things hopefully improve, I think some of them will, will kind of move forward with plans that they've been shelving for, you know, a year now or so.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eLet's talk a bit more specifically, Nick, about what Renaissance Capital is focusing on. It’s the only ETF that's focused on tracking newly public companies. Could just define for us what newly Public means within what timeframe recently?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eEssentially, it's designed to provide investors with exposure to a portfolio of the largest and most liquid, newly listed IPOs. And so we're looking at a time frame of three years, basically, from when a company enters the index to leaves it. I mean, kind of view that as you know, that's an area of stage of life, where companies might not be included in major indices yet. So really, if you want to get exposure to that side of the market, our ETF is a way to do that. And basically, we take the IPO market, we try to cut off at about 100 million deal size, and then only talk at the top 80% and serve the market. And so the rationale is to provide exposure to the most liquid names within the IPO space. So we're, as opposed to maybe some of the small issuers that are a little low liquidity. And yeah, so and again, so that's for U.S. listed IPOs, including foreign companies that may list in the U.S.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eThe way we think about it is, you know, most investors are going to own, you know, funds that give them exposure to the broad equity markets, maybe it's, you know, the S\u0026amp;P 500 or other indices. But the challenge with those is that those tend to hold very mature companies, especially the S\u0026amp;P or the Dow, obviously, but other ETFs as well will hold, tend to add companies several years after they list and in some cases, you know, many years.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd so, when we look at the IPO market, we think that's not really being captured in traditional investment products, investment funds, just because those companies are usually not added to major indices early. So we look at that IPO ETF as a way to kind of complement an existing portfolio of other stocks to really get exposure to the whole IPO or to the sorry, to the whole equity markets, you need to have some exposure to IPOs. And certainly investors can do their homework and can look at individual offerings, and kind of assess the risks and rewards of those. And, you know, we certainly encourage that with some of our other products like our IPO Pro, which is a product designed to trap the IPO market for active investors. But for those who kind of don't want to be doing that work, frankly, the IPO ETF is kind of just a way to get exposure to the broader IPO market\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eAnd the index based approach, Nick, just walk us through the benefit of that. It’s a little bit taking the work out of it to your point, but what else should we be thinking about when we're looking at ETFs and the benefits of having an index based system?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNick Einhorn: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eExactly. It's designed to be, you know, entirely rules-based. So it's very transparent. And again, you can look at our website and the documentation there. At our firm a lot of our business is looking, you know, doing active fundamental research on IPOs for our institutional clients. And so there's certainly, you know, we certainly value the benefit of doing research on individual IPOs. But for a broad portfolio, we think that that kind of rules based approach, we're really capturing the whole IPO market in a way that we think makes sense and we're waiting based on floats or kind of capturing the liquidity of the market, we think that makes sense for investors who just want exposure to the broad IPO market.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNick Einhorn, VP of Research at Renaissance Capital.

But before we dig into artificial intelligence in general, would you mind just giving listeners a little bit of background on Soundhound and what the business does?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eSo I started three companies in undergrad and but after I graduated, I decided that I wanted to be a technical founder of a super high-tech company that would make a big impact in the world. So I went to Stanford University, and I got my Ph.D. in electrical engineering. And as I was looking for that, what would that next big change would be? I turned to science fiction, and in particular, Star Trek; I said, what do they have in stock? We don't have obvious answers like spaceships that go faster than light and teleportation and holodecks and replicators. But the one that was less obvious was voice AI. So the ability to talk to computers and robots and devices and rooms and have a natural conversation with them and ask them to do things and ask them to answer questions. And I thought that's something that would happen, for sure. And in my lifetime, and without conclusion, I started working from a dorm room at Stanford with my co-founders.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry:\u003c/strong\u003e Because science fiction does tend to become science fact over time. Right. That's, that's the old adage. So fast forward to today. Kayvon, you're out of your Stanford dorm. Talk to us about how the market for voice AI has evolved and what exactly SoundHound is doing. What does the product actually deliver?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eWe spent the first 10 years in stealth, so we kept to the secret. And we wanted to own the technology and make it better than anything else that was out there, and it took 10 years. But we finally achieved that milestone, and we unveiled it a few years ago. And today, we are one of the few companies that completely owns the full stack of voice AI and conversational AI in-house. So there are a lot of players. But most of those use a platform like ours. And we are one of the very few technology providers. And one of the unique attributes of SoundHound is that we aim really high. And we solve super complex problems that push the boundaries of what is possible. For example, what others are trying to do is they want to make computers catch up to humans in language understanding. But our goal is to make computers better than humans so they can do things that humans cannot do. And we are able to support really complex conversations. And that can make people more productive and make the world a better place. And I'll give you an example. Let's say you are looking for a restaurant and you had Chinese food yesterday. So you don't want Chinese food today. You still don't ask a personal assistant to show me restaurants except for Chinese because you don't think they will work. You kind of have learned the boundaries of where they fail and you just operate in that boundary. You ask them simple questions based on keywords. And if you do ask them to show me restaurants except for Chinese, they all say here are some Chinese restaurants where they actually give you the opposite of what you want. But without technology, you can say here's an example actually works. Today Show me Asian restaurants in San Francisco, excluding Chinese and Japanese, and only show the ones that have more than three stars and are open after 9 pm On Wednesday, and you get exactly what you want. Then you can follow up and refine it, and you have a conversation in a complex conversation. So most of our customers choose us because of our superior tech. But they also choose us because you're an independent provider of voice AI. So we don't hijack their brand, product, user, and data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eSo Keyvan, give us a really specific example of that, to bring this to life for the community. So you just gave the example where voice AI was effectively being used for search, right, that you are articulating, I want to find a restaurant with this cuisine in this area. In that example, who is your client? Is it the search engine is that the restaurant and into what device or into what platform is the user speaking to get that search result?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eSo we power devices and services. So with our cars, TVs, IoT devices, appliances, and those are the endpoints to interact with, you know, these domains. And then we also power services. So, for example, for restaurants. When was the last time you call the restaurant to place an order and you had a good experience, they usually don't pick up the phone. And when they pick up the phone, they are very distracted; it's noise in the background, and they are serving people walking in. And our solution addresses that problem. We take over their phone line; we always pick up the phone so you don't miss restaurants don't miss on any calls. And we give a really good experience for every user. We take their orders, we answer their questions, upsell people and give them recommendations. So we power products and services. And we have this ecosystem vision where we bring them together. So the services that we've voice-enabled now can be accessed by the users of products like you're driving your car, you can order food, you can book appointments, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berr: \u003c/strong\u003eGot it. I mentioned at the beginning that you do service smart devices; you've repeated them: TVs, autos, and restaurants came on to give us a sense of how big your addressable market is, how far you've penetrated it, and how much room there is left to run.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eThe voice AI category in the stock market is estimated to become 160 billion. And if you include search and monetization, you know that search is today keyword based. And Google makes a lot of money for keyword-based because people search with keywords advertisers bid on those keywords. If you include the concept that the next generation of searches conversational AI and comes from advertising, it will be much bigger than that. And there are very few providers because of the high barrier to entry. And today, we powered millions of products. The power of Vizio TVs, for example, they're the second-largest TV maker in the US. Just in the last few years, we have 17 car brands have chosen SoundHound, which is very impressive. And beyond TV and automotive, the power products like Snapchat, and Pandora, we work for companies like Netflix and MasterCard to become a robust IoT (Internet of Things) devices. We announced a strategic partnership with Qualcomm to integrate voice AI into their Snapdragon chipsets and the new Italian service fee analysis that sounds for restaurants that I just talked about.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eGreat overview. It's incredible to hear just how far SoundHoud has come from that 10 years and stealth to now having a public company out there and in full visibility. Let's talk a little bit more about AI trends more broadly came on and specifically within Voice AI. Can you talk a little bit more about AI trends more broadly came on and specifically within voice? Can you talk about whether you've seen the market for voice AI tech become a bit more crowded and how SoundHound has kept its edge and a competitive advantage?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eSo I usually, so there are a lot of players in voice because Voice AI is happening, and people are adopting it, and there's a big demand for it. But there's a high barrier to entry. So the core technology providers in voice AI, I will say, a handful at a global scale. I usually say it takes 10 years to create voice AI technologies. And it takes three years to realize it will take 10 years, so I've seen several companies with resources start on the pack and then abandon it. So there's a really high barrier to entry, and as a platinum provider in multiple languages in multiple regions, multiple industries. Soundhound is very unique. So we support about 25 languages. We support multiple industries. We are in Asia; we are in Europe, we are in North America and South America, and we claim to be the best tech. And again a lot of customers are to choose us mainly for the quality of the tech. And the fact that you're independent and we don't hijack their brand and users.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eCould you talk a little bit cable and about how voice AI benefits consumers now and maybe in the future, and just what are some of the more surprising applications that, you know, the average person doesn't really know about yet? What are the hidden nuggets of the use cases that you've seen in your experience?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eI would answer that question by explaining our three-pillar business strategy because it's very innovative. You know, we've been innovating in the tech, but we also try to be innovative in the business. And the three-pillar business strategy is the answer to that. So let me explain what that is. So in the first pillar, we power devices and products like cars, TVs, and IoT devices. There will be 75 billion IoT devices projected by 2025. So the order of magnitude is larger than smartphones. And most of these devices don't have either the physical room or economical room to add, like a touchscreen or keyboard, or mouse. But the microphone is small and inexpensive. And that's all it takes to add voice to these products. So 75 billion devices, from cars, TVs, IoT devices, and appliances, can be voice-enabled. That's our pillar one. And the business model before that is very proven, you know, we get a royalty. And then we have edge and cloud. In the second pillar, we power services, like food ordering for restaurants and customer service, and think of restaurants as what books spread on Amazon. So Amazon started by selling books. They only did that a lot of people knew Amazon as an online bookstore. And when they did that really well, they did more things. And now they sell everything from A to Z. So for restaurants, there's a very complex problem. We have a lot of focus on that now. And then we'll expand to other areas. So that would be pillar two. So pillar one, and pillar two, are very, very proven business models; they don't depend on each other success of one doesn't depend on the success of the other one. And the third pillar is when we bring them together. So we bring the services that the voice-enabled to the products that be voice-enabled. And that creates a commerce ecosystem. So while you're driving your car, you can talk to your car to control the air conditioning and the radio and navigation, then you can also order food, conveniently and from restaurants that we are both enabled. And this ecosystem benefits everyone. Users, who are the most important part of the equation, are delighted because of the convenience and speed of ordering. Restaurants are happy because they get new leads from the ecosystem. And there's a lead revenue that they share with us. And then, we share that revenue with the product leaders with that car maker with the TV maker. And they benefit as well because, in many cases, they are able to generate incremental recurring revenue for the first time from the product.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eFascinating; it's been such an interesting part of the debate around AI lately, lots of conversation, talking about how the users of these new technologies are going to have to think perhaps much differently about privacy, or bias, or other ethical topics. When it comes specifically to voice AI and everything that you've seen. What are maybe some of the challenges through that ethical or privacy-focused lens that your space faces?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eOh, yeah, so those are big challenges. And they're distinct challenges to privacy is one and bias another one. So we've seen, you know, videos and write the news when you know AI does says the wrong thing or unacceptable things undesired outcome, those happen, and the privacy's and other things like devices are always listening. So on the privacy side, that's one of the advantages that we deliver to our customers: we let them define their privacy policy and let them be as transparent as they want. And as restrictive as they want. In the way, they integrate both AI. And that's one of the disadvantages that, for example, if they get it from the big tech, they just inherit their privacy policy; whatever it is, they can't really control it. So we give flexibility to our customers. And one of the areas that can address privacy concerns is the recognition of the edge. So there's the cloud, and there's the edge so, so you're increasingly seeing both demand from our customers and our ability to run everything on the edge. So, for example, that user's voice doesn't need to leave the device, and then you can have devices that always listen without sharing your audio with third parties. On the bias. That's another challenge. And we are committed to being a pioneer in addressing those challenges. Our approach is that we combine machine learning models and software engineering algorithms to create our solutions. And the software sets the boundaries for the machine learning models. And then machine learning models are companions that make our solutions better within those boundaries that are set by our software engineers. So most of these undesired outcomes, and these are scenarios that you see in the news and other demos, are when machine learning models don't have boundaries, and then they learn from bad data, and then they have unpredictable behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eTo wrap everything together, Keyvan, what are some of the priorities that you and your team have in 2023 and beyond were the big growth opportunities that you guys are looking to lean into?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeyvan Mohajer: \u003c/strong\u003eSo the world has changed. And we are adapting and transforming to the change changes. We are transforming to be a much more financially efficient organization by reducing our costs while still growing our revenue at a very healthy rate. And our goal is to become profitable and cashflow positive within this year. We announced at the end of Q3 of the year, in quiet periods after only us will be publicly disclosed last time end of Q3 we had over $300 million of booking backlog. These are from committed customers. So we have a really solid foundation for our revenue growth with our reduced costs and increased focus. We believe we will increase our revenue growth this year, and we'll achieve our goal of becoming cash flow positive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eThese are big goals, and wishing you all the very best of luck as you pursue those. Just thank you again, Keyvan Mohajer. For everything you shared with us, and your insights, it has been a long journey and really ahead of the explosion in interest.

","transcript":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eHello everybody and welcome to Public Live. I'm your host Ann Berry and looking back, it has been a bit of a bumpy and unpredictable year in the markets. But some pockets did see momentum, one of them being electric vehicles, which stand to benefit potentially from the Inflation Reduction Act that was passed earlier this year. So that's what we're going to focus on today, electric vehicles or EVs, their latest developments, and what's on the horizon as we head into 2023. Here to discuss all of this is Jay Jacobs, US head of Thematics and Active Equity ETFs at iShares. Jay, welcome back to Public Life.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd thanks so much for having me. It is great to be back on Public Live for one more time in 2022.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eI cannot believe 2022 is nearly over. I feel like the EV sector share, when you look at their share prices, are probably pretty glad that we're going into a new year, a new chapter, and putting this one behind us definitely had a busy couple of years, we have seen looking back at this year an increased interest from consumers, two major ride-hailing companies all promising to adopt electric vehicles into their fleets and the industry has been one that just can't seem to slow down. So I'd love to kick off today's show with you by walking through some of the highlights that you've tracked from the last year in the sector.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, I would say there are a few things. You know, first off, this was really kind of the year where EVs became less of a niche product and more of a mainstream product. We see that in adoption numbers. So if you look at the first half of 2022, EVS made up 26% of car sales in China, about 20% of passenger car sales in Europe, and the US actually lagging behind by only about 6%. But that is still very big numbers in a very large market around the world, showing that EVs are really coming onto the scene in a meaningful way. You add, on top of that, that we've had several car models come out this year. So basically, every major car brand has an EV now, and you see, it's not just sports cars, SUVs, it's vans, it's lower price sedans, really a model for every kind of buyer and price point out there. And then finally, yeah, we have the Inflation Reduction Act, which is one of the largest commitments ever to support the adoption of electric vehicles and clean energy, about $370 billion from the US government over the next 10 years or so, which is going to provide things like subsidies for building EV subsidies for buying EVs to really accelerate the growth of this segment. So it was, yes, 2020 was a difficult year for almost any investor in any segment of the market. EVs not being the exception. But there were a lot of things to still get excited about in the Eevee space and 2022.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eJay, let's break down a little bit more the legislation and hone in on the role of the Inflation Reduction Act. You hit the headlines for $370 billion over how long is that investment going to be made?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so it's roughly over about 10 years. This doesn't all get spent at once. And that's kind of the design, right, is that what the IRA is trying to do is accelerate the adoption of a technology that otherwise is seeing good adoption, but the US government wants to do it faster. And there are really two different ways to do that. One is increased demand. And the easiest way to increase demand is to make something cheaper. So the way that they're doing that is a $7,500 tax credit for new EVs, a $4,000 tax credit for used EVs, spurring demand by making them more affordable. The other way to do that is to increase supply. And that's actually incredibly important in the market that we're in today. Because there are actually not enough EVs to buy right now. If you try to buy a Ford F150 Lightning, you can't do it. If you want to buy, you know, some of the top models, you know, model three long ranges and make Mustangs, there are long waits, if you can even get on a waitlist right now. So the idea is, how do we spur more supply by using things like incentive tax credits and production tax credits to get these companies to build more manufacturing plants in the United States as well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eInteresting that you break down the demand and supply aspects of it so succinctly, Jay. When you think about which of those pieces are going to have the nearest term momentum, tax credits for purchasing EVs, when are they going to kick in, and then subsidies for buying more EV plants? When are they going to start getting kicked in?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eWhen the tax credits get hit as early as next year? The tax credits for building manufacturing plants could also start to come into play next year. But you know, we have to realize building a manufacturing plant is a two to three-year, four-year process even so we're not really going to see the commercial benefits of that for some time.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eLet's let's look a little bit more at trends for 2023, specifically Jay, which industries are looking to add EVs to their fleets? The famous one, of course, was Amazon, which had an agreement with Rivian to try and bring EVs into their delivery fleets. What are the other examples that you can walk us through of different industries moving into electric vehicle adoption?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eI think two are really exciting right now. So one is when we look at semi trucks, so the 18-wheelers you see on the highway, very expensive vehicles that use a lot of gas. We're starting to see progress in the electrification of that fleet. And astute listeners may have noticed the Tesla semi has been tested on the roads recently, with companies like PepsiCo putting in orders for dozens of Tesla semis going forward. So that's a really exciting development in switching the fleet from gas to electric. And then secondly, this just came out yesterday; the US Postal Service, which is the biggest operator of vehicles in the federal government in the United States, is going to put in place about 66,000 electric vehicles over the next decade or so. So this is massive, this is going from, you know, just electric vehicles being kind of a niche sports car, to really being the predominant form of passenger vehicles or light-duty vehicles or even heavy-duty vehicles and the Tesla semi example going forward. So these are exciting times.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eThis is x 1000s. Quite the number doing know, Jay, which manufacturers and which brands are going to be procured from.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, they're there from a couple of brands. One is Oshkosh, which is more of a military supply company, but builds a lot of postal service car tracks, and the others are going to come from the private sector, more from major car brands even announced which ones yet. Here's the fun fact, though, the little postal service truck that people have seen on the roads for decades only gets about eight miles per gallon. So you can see pretty quickly how switching to an electric really ramps up the efficiency of the postal service not just to reduce emissions, but to reduce operating costs; no longer paying so much for gas can actually really lower costs for shipping.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eLet's talk a little bit about EV stocks, Jay, because for people interested in electric vehicles and looking to play in the market, I'm curious if you'd be able to share some of the high-level signals or metrics that you and your team look for when evaluating EV players?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eSure. So really, the primary thing that we look at is revenue from the EV ecosystem. Now the art in that is really what is the EV ecosystem. It's very obvious to say that EV manufacturers, like some of the hubs that we've mentioned already, are very key to the electric manufacturers like some of the hubs that we've mentioned already are very key to the electric vehicle theme. But it actually goes far beyond that. And so you can think about, you know, who are the companies that actually build the batteries that go into electric vehicles, they're obviously part of the ecosystem, who's doing the lithium mining and processing that goes into those batteries, who's building the electronics and the parts that are supplied into electric vehicles. And there are really dozens of companies beyond some of the headline names that are really participating in the ecosystem. We often call this thematic beta or thematic risk, the risk here being these companies are tied to the potential adoption of electric vehicles. If the adoption for electric vehicles happens the way that we expect it to, these companies will be rewarded for that risk. If electric vehicles get supplanted by new technology, or for some reason, don't make it, they don't get escape velocity, and the internal combustion engine lives on, then companies with this thematic risk would be punished. But what we are really looking at is what are the companies that have that highest thematic risk to the electric vehicle ecosystem. And we really measure that by who gets the most revenue from electric vehicles and the entire ecosystem.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd how about in the US versus internationally? I mean, the Inflation Reduction Act here in the US has caused enormous momentum domestically. Are there players you look at or parts of the supply chain that you look at internationally and that are publicly traded?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eOh, absolutely. Yeah. I mean, this is a theme that is not confined to borders. Yes, we saw, you know, the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States. You know, we've seen other efforts in China and Europe to spur greater electric vehicle adoption as well. So it's really a global theme, and we see global companies participating in it. There are a lot of battery manufacturers coming from South Korea and beyond. There are a lot of lithium miners in Australia. There are parts suppliers all around the world as well. So when we think about this theme, we are absolutely looking at it through global hubs.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eCan we talk a little bit about how EV ETFs work Jay, as an investor, thinking about adding EV exposure to their portfolio\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, absolutely. So EV ETFs are really trying to get exposure to that EV ecosystem by investing in companies around the world. So, for example, our IDRV ETF and iShares invest in lithium mining companies, refiners, battery producers, and car manufacturers in the electric vehicle space, as well as part suppliers, and really provides exposure to that entire ecosystem in one ETF. This has many benefits for investors, but one of them being it's hard to identify these companies on your own because they're not just US large-cap brand names. It can be smaller international companies. It's just hard for individual investors to access this ecosystem at the individual stock level. Secondly, there's just a lot of efficiency and doing this through an ETF rather than going out and buying 50 companies around the world on your own. You can put in an order for one ETF like IDRV and get exposure to that entire basket with one trade. So, you know, when we design an ETF like IDRV, we're really focused on capturing the pure-play companies across the entire ecosystem of a theme, in this case, electric vehicles, to get that exposure to investors.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd then, Jay, could you give us a little bit of color on a couple of things that help with the myth-busting? Because EVs have tended to seem like the cars of the future. They're sort of here with us now. But what are some of the assumptions that people may still have about electric vehicles that maybe just aren't true?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eI think one of the biggest misconceptions is that they're still expensive. Yes, there are EVs at very high price points. But there's actually several models that are coming in below the average purchase price of a new vehicle in the United States, which is about $50,000 these days. On top of that, you have tax credits, which can make them even cheaper. And then, on top of that, you have lower maintenance. So electric vehicles don't need an oil change each year. Actually, through regenerative braking, it's less frequent that you need to do brake pads and brake rotor replacement. No spark plugs to replace every 50,000 miles. So it is already cheaper in many instances to own an electric vehicle than an internal combustion engine when you look at the entire lifetime ownership. So you ought you add all that together. And the economic argument for electric vehicles is really starting to come into the forefront here, which we believe is only going to accelerate adoption. It's not just about is this a better car? Do I like the car? Do I like how it looks? If it is cheaper off the land or cheaper over the lifetime ownership experience? We think that's really going to bring the mass markets into the Evie space.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eWhat about Jay, one thing that just come up? Recently, I looked at a company that was trying to find ways to make it easier for Evie owners to be able to charge their vehicles. How about that element? Is the infrastructure going to be there to support getting more electric vehicles on the roads?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJay Jacobs: \u003c/strong\u003eIt's certainly growing. And we've been talking a lot about the Inflation Reduction Act. But another piece of policy in the United States is really accelerating electric charging, which was the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act passed last November. The idea behind that act is to put about seven and a half billion dollars into building 500,000 chargers around the country. So a lot more densification of electric charging. This, in many ways, is basically a subsidy for EV buyers because if there are more chargers and there are faster chargers, in the places that you want to see them. You don't need as big of a battery. And so, if you have a smaller battery, you don't have to pay as much for an electric vehicle. So you can see how different policies from the US government are really trying to accelerate adoption, whether it's tax credits for buyers, whether it's incentives for manufacturers, or building up a charging infrastructure.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnn Berry: \u003c/strong\u003eWith that, I want to thank you, Jay Jacobs, Head of Thematics and Active Equity ETFs at iShares.

Thank you so much for joining us. My name is Julia Rothacker. I'm the director of concierge here at Public. And we're thrilled to be with you today to talk a little bit about the reggae IPO of Shrek music royalties. Keith, would you like to introduce yourself?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHey Julia, for those who haven't met me yet? I am Keith Marshall GM of alternatives here at Public.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePerfect then let's dive straight in. Keith. I know this is a serious investment. But I'm also guessing everybody wants to hear about Shrek.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course. You know, as most of you should already know. Shrek is a bad tempered but good hearted ogre, who goes on a variety of quests in his fairy tale world. So Shrek is just a massive media franchise. It's the 17th highest-grossing film franchise of all time. And the second-highest-grossing animated film franchise which generated over $4 billion in box office sales just wild stats. And interestingly, there's actually a rumored fifth film possibly to be called Shrek Five. And you know as it's grown, the Shrek franchise has just really kept pace with streaming becoming evermore important in this media landscape. So the first two films launched on Netflix in March 2022. And were in the top 10 viewed when they were launched. Another wild stat customers watched 20.8 million Shrek and Shrek Two in the week they launched on Netflix. Those two movies have since shifted over to Peacock, which is obviously the affiliated owner of the Shrek franchise, but some are still visible on Netflix.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGreat. And now let's shift a bit to what the investment offering is here. What exactly is a royalty?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYeah, most people actually don't know what royalties are so short answer royalty interests are intellectual property. They're part of the copyright law. So really, the royalties are the actual payments. So the royalties are the payments that come to us from use of this content, the Shrek underlying content, and they're collected by what's known as performing rights organizations basically just like large clearing houses. These PRO's are what actually manage the rights on behalf of rights holders. So royalties are actual payments PRO's their job is to collect these payments from all these underlying sources of content distribution when the music from the Shrek franchise really you know the actual movies are used.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks Keith and can you explain what exactly triggers a royalty payment for FRAC?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo this catalogue generates royalties from a bunch of different sources you know, use of the tracks in the movies when the movies are streamed or sold on theme park rides there's a holiday TV special called Shrek The Halls there are even Broadway plays about Shrek all of these different things lead to royalties being generated. And you know, that's it even makes money when the movie I Am Legend plays because Will Smith's character actually watches Shrek during I Am Legend. So a significant portion of these royalty earnings have come from international sources. So this asset actually benefits from not being tied solely to the US market as well. Relatedly there are a ton of references on Reddit videos on YouTube about people actually learning English from watching Shrek, that may be one of the reasons that international viewing is and has been so strong for Shrek. But you know, of course, broadcast and streaming represent the main portion of earnings just because you know the people watching Shrek so a question that's come up a few times from people that I want to clarify. This is the score, not the soundtrack. So Smash Mouth all-star is not included. But like Fairy Tale which some of you may know from recently going viral on TikTok is included. So this is the score just the underlying orchestral music.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYes, I certainly have seen Fairy Tale a lot recently. So that gives a lot of clarity on how Our Shrek royalties work, and I am a big Shrek fan. So I love it. But this is also a an investment. Why would someone invest in royalties?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, as an attorney, we have to present a disclaimer, investors should always do their own research and understand all of these risks to consider before investing. But, you know, stepping back public's goal as a platform is to give investors tools that's investment products, and actually the education as well to build these modern diversified portfolios. And to answer your question, royalties can produce cash flow, which you know, in the current interest rate environment can definitely be appealing to investors. So in the case of the Shrek offering, any royalties received by the entity that holds these royalty interests will be paid out in the form of quarterly dividends. So royalties also benefit from being less correlated with other assets, you know, like Exchange Traded equities, because, again, they're driven by content consumption, not you know, for example, what the stock market is doing going up and down or doesn't, those things don't directly impact how people are watching Shrek and reduce correlation, cashflow. These can help investors lower portfolio volatility and hopefully increase returns on a risk-adjusted basis. So royalties are an investment tool.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks. And I understand that royalties are actually an established asset class.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYeah, so most people don't realize that this really is an investment product. And, you know, to date, institutional investors have just dominated the space is a direct example, the Michigan State employee pension funds have billions of dollars invested in music royalties, and catalogs can just sell for massive amounts, like the recent $225 million sale of Katy Perry's catalogue. You know, most people just can't participate in something like that. So with the Shrek royalties offering, investors can access royalties with as little as a $10 investment. And, you know, most of us don't have hundreds of millions to spend on a single asset, but Public wants to make these public markets actually work for all people. So this offering makes royalties more accessible to everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat makes sense. And why Shrek music within all music royalties,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eyou know, we talked about the Shrek franchise, and that's actually not the starting point for this thing. First and foremost, it's a mature asset. It has a 20-plus-year earnings history. And while we can't predict performance, you know, that means we're not relying on like how a single song by a single artist has done in the past year to assess what could happen in the next five years. It's also a strong recent historical performance, you know, earnings have actually grown in recent years due in part to streaming. We saw that last year with an earnings bump from Shrek on Netflix. And again, past performance is, of course, no guarantee of future results, but it makes our own analysis more meaningful. So comparing the 2022 calendar year earnings to the offering amount, the asset produced an eight-and-a-half percent return after fees. So it's also a life of rights interest, meaning this royalty interest is valid for the life of the composer Harry Gregson Williams plus seven years and Gregson Williams is 61 As of today. Lastly, it is Shrek we already discussed like it's an awesome media property and you know, Shrek Five could theoretically reinvigorate interest in the rest of the franchise, which could potentially increase royalty earnings. So again, Shrek Five does not yet have a release date. And recent strikes could of course, delay that, but we hope the movie is indeed forthcoming.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOkay, Keith, last question for you. How does the process work if someone wants to invest?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKeith\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo the offering is $889,700 in total $10 a share, but it can be oversubscribed. So we can actually take in requests for more than the 889k. As of today, the offering is reached about 77% of its total allocation. So it really just you go in the Public app or on our site and you can request shares at the Shrek asset page. After we receive these requests for at least the total offering amount the 889,700 we will process the closing and at that point, investors will be eligible for dividends after the closing. In addition to being eligible for these dividends, investors can participate in a secondary market, meaning they can buy and sell shares from one another on the Public platform. And I want to close out with a reminder that dividend payments aren't guaranteed. They depend directly on the consumption of Shrek to keep generating royalties. So, always do your own research.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJulia\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAbsolutely. Keith, thank you so much for providing this overview of the Shrek music royalties offering. And thank you all for joining and listening to us. So with that, have a great rest of your day.

I'm your host Anne Berry and today's show is brought to you by Tema ETFs. Joining us today as our guest is Yuri Khodjimurian, CFA and Chief Investment Officer at Tema ETFs, an issuer focused on bottom-up investing in unique structural themes like their toll, that's ticker T-O-L-L ETF. We're going to unpack that further. Yuri, welcome to the Public Podcast. Great to have you on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYuri Khodjamirian:\u003c/strong\u003e Thank you very much.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB\u003c/strong\u003e: Yuri, let's start right there with that lead-in and talk about the $TOLL ETF that you at Tema have launched and how that's indicative of the way that you approach investing as a team.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, absolutely. I mean, $TOLL is probably an exemplary ETF of the kind of thematics that Tema is trying to bring to the market. I think a lot of thematic issuers often go for what I would term kind of more fatty type themes like artificial intelligence or what may you, that are more related to what I would call aggressive growth. At Tema, we're trying to be very thoughtful about kind of the companies that go into a particular theme and also the themes that have long-term durability. So $TOLL or the monopolies and oligopolies ETF, basically investing companies that operate in monopolistic or oligopolistic industries. And this is kind of, you've probably heard the Warren Buffett term moat. Think of this as kind of an ever-expanding moat with crocodiles in it that hopefully lasts rather than kind of a couple of years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eAnd that's sort of the idea behind it. And it's all about quality companies within it, right? Rather than maybe necessarily going just for growth, which a lot of thematics tend to do. So I took a look at some of the companies that are listed. This is as of June 30th in the public disclosures, Yuri, you've got, I think your top two holdings as of that point in time, included the credit rating agencies, you've got S\u0026amp;P and Moody's in there. And then you've got a number of French industrial companies. I saw that your weighting's France, you know, France is about 15% as of that point in time. Take us through some of those names. Again, you've got the rating agencies. What are some of the others and why are they in your ETF at the size that they are?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, absolutely. I mean, look, what we're looking for are companies that operate in an industry that is essentially either has one, two, or three players maximum, which are concentrated where there's essentially monopolistic or oligopolistic structure. So if you take the credit rating agencies, there are three in the entire world. And in fact, really there are two, S\u0026amp;P and Moody's effectively control most of the market between them. There's also Fitch, but it's a kind of smaller player, more distant kind of third player in that market. Similarly, with the French industrial company, so we own Airbus, which is a manufacturer of airplanes. And as we all know, there are only two manufacturers of airplanes in the world. There's Airbus and Boeing. And so we've gone for Airbus in our portfolio. Essentially that kind of gives you a flavor of the types of industries we're looking for, right? Two players really concentrated market share between those two players. And that creates a lot of really fascinating dynamics because one, we believe that this industry structure is going to maintain for a very long time. So if you take aerospace, right, what you get there is this is a highly regulated industry. It takes forever and costs a lot of money to develop a new airplane. People have tried different manufacturers before, but nobody's really succeeded apart from Airbus and Boeing. And that's because safety is really important. It takes ages to certify and test a plane and to develop one to make a lot of money. And so that's the kind of durability of that monopoly that we think will endure over a long, long period of time. And it's a similar thing with credit rating agencies. What's happening with them is they get as they rate more and more companies, they get more and more data and information about other companies. And that maintains their advantage because for competitors to come in and recreate that database, it's going to be very, very difficult to do. That advantage maintains for a long period of time and in it creates really fascinating kind of financials, which we think benefits the stock price over the long term.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, let's talk about that, Yuri. Is it necessarily the case that having a high amount of concentration in an industry does translate into, for example, decent growth, not use the term aggressive growth for some of the other companies out there? Let's just say decent growth for these companies, above average margins, strong free cash flow. Are those characteristics you always see in the kinds of industry structures that you're talking about?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah, I mean, it's a fascinating question, right? I think what the most important metric where it kind of comes out is probably return on invested capital, which is a moniker of high quality companies. So all of the companies that operate in monopolistic industries tend to have higher returns on invested capital. Now, obviously, you know, our funds tries to select the best monopolies, ones where there's sort of durable advantage over a long period of time. And that means that necessarily maybe you'll have a monopoly where you have high returns, but the companies don't say invest in a new innovation and squander that advantage. And over time, industry structure collapses because new competitors come in. Because remember, it's a competitive capitalistic market, right? So people are always trying to go after this high, they see these high returns are like, oh, I could have a piece of that. And they try to enter. And so what we're looking for are monopolies that are very strong, right? They're taking some of these cash flows and not instead of enriching their shows or reinvesting back into their business and creating stronger and stronger modes. And that's why you can't just kind of pick a few of these companies and hold them over the long term. You want to be able to spend a lot of time analyzing and understanding the ones that are going to be very durable over a long period of time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eYuri, walk us through a couple of the factors that create these monopolistic or oligopolistic structures in the first place. Regulation is one, you've already pointed to that with respect to Airbus. What are other sources, create of the kinds of moat you're talking about?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, exactly. And that kind of gets to the heart of what a monopoly is, these sources of competitive advantage. And if you read the industrial economic literature, or you know, you've sort of been in the stock market and look at businesses for long enough, you can kind of find five major sources of competitive advantage. Regulation is one. So think maybe even patented pharmaceuticals or some of these things that I've talked about in the aerospace area, you have a high switching costs. So that is if a customer there's an extreme cost for me to switch. Aerospace is a perfect example of that, right? Once these parts are certified, for example, if you're a supplier to Airbus, like we own an engine manufacturer, once that engine's been certified on that plane, it's going nowhere. It's not gonna be replaced by a competitor anytime soon. And that high switching cost is effectively why the monopoly persists over a long period of time. Then we have network effects. So that is where an additional user added to the network, creates so much value for the other users, it grows the value of the whole network for everyone who uses it. And a perfect example of that is a financial exchange, right? The more people trade on a financial exchange, the more liquidity there is, the higher the value to any individual user. And that network effect builds up a big value for that particular monopolistic industry like exchange. We can get onto how those dynamics play out over time in some other industries like tech. You also have economies of scale. So that is where how you build up enough sufficient scale that the individual unit cost of production goes down so much that no competitor can come in and compete with you. Semiconductor manufacturing is a perfect example of that. There are only a few companies that can manufacture the most leading edge semiconductors, which are by the way the most efficient way of manufacturing semiconductors. No one can compete with them on cost per transistor. And so therefore you have this advantage that other people can't get and it will take a very, very long time for them to reach, created almost impossible in some cases. And then the final one is kind of non-replicable physical assets. So this is where you have a physical asset in the physical world that you can't create again. Railroad is a perfect example of that. In the United States, you currently have six class one, which is large railroad companies, that effectively divide the whole country between them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah. What's an example of that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK:\u003c/strong\u003e...building, recreating that railroad network is virtually impossible. I mean, you'll never get the permission for what you will. And so, you know, one thing you can almost say with certainty is that in 30 years, it will be the same railroad companies that are around us now. Exactly, you can't replicate those particular assets over time. And so you've effectively created a, sometimes people refer to in the literature as a natural monopoly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eIf we're not flying around, they're not going away any time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK: \u003c/strong\u003eSo those would be like the five forces, right? Regulation, high switching costs, economies of scale, network effects, and non-replicable physical assets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, let's dig into one sector that has shown elements of those, you know, some of the five, not all of the five, but just gets a ton of coverage as a result. And that's the tech sector. And, Yuri, when we think about even the fact that the Magnificent Seven, right, is called the Magnificent Seven, there's a number around, there are acronyms around it, shows at least when it comes to capturing share of the public exchanges as concentration. And often that's because those companies themselves have achieved some of those monopolistic or oligopolistic benefits that you've described. Social media is one of those sub-sectors of tech where we see this kind of concentration in terms of the numbers of players. Let's dig into that a little bit. I mean, talk a little bit about what made those monopolies as clearly network effects, but why has it been so hard to disrupt the social media space?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, it's fascinating. I mean, we get asked about the technology sector a lot because, you know, obviously spending a lot of time looking and understanding where monopolistic industries, we're actually of the view that the technology sector is very difficult to actually say there are real durable long-term monopolies. And remember, I'm talking decades here and not necessarily the kind of a couple of years or even 20 years for that matter. And the reason for that technology is almost synonymous with disruption, right? And so sometimes you'll have what might appear monopolistic structures, but suddenly some new technology will come along and completely disrupt and change the whole paradigm. Yeah, so TikTok's a perfect example of that. One of the fascinating things about TikTok, if you dig into its history, is that one point in 2018, TikTok was taking 25% of all Facebook ads on iOS devices in the United States. I mean, just let that sink in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eLike TikTok. Like TikTok just came into that, yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK: \u003c/strong\u003eA quarter of every four ads, one of them was a TikTok ad. This was when TikTok was nothing. So they used Facebook's network to build their own business and the results were staggering, right? I mean, if you look at the number of minutes people, especially younger people use and spend on TikTok versus Instagram or Snapchat, it's just, you know, the charts gone this way, right? And they built this advantage by using Facebook's network that Facebook has effectively given to them through these advertising dollars. And this speaks to another really interesting point about media and social media in general. They're all competing for our time, right? And time is actually quite a limited resource if you think about it. We all have how much you work or if you're Elon Musk, you have many more hours or whatever. You have 18, let's call it, or 16 hours in the day. If you're not sleeping that much, that's it. And that's what these media companies are competing for. And so that attention means that it's a much more competitive market than a market for dollars or freight or whatever it might be that kind of has infinite potential to keep growing and get bigger. The other side to this is advertising, right? Because what they're trying to do, these businesses, especially in the tech space, is they're trying to go for advertising dollars. And what I've found fascinating over the last kind of five years is companies that you would not necessarily associate with advertising have chosen advertising as their kind of new revenue stream. And the reason I bring this up is if everyone's converging on the same advertising dollars, that makes that pool of advertising dollars much more competitive than any other pool of money around. So if you take like Uber or Instacart or Amazon, you know, if you look at a typical Amazon page right now, most of that page are advertisement that other people have paid for. That to me is telling me that advertising dollar is not going to Google or Facebook, it's going to Amazon. And o it creates this competition and suddenly Uber is advertising on the app and Instacart is advertising retail when you're trying to buy your groceries. And so you're competing for the same dollars because it's a limited amount. Sure, it's growing, but it's a limited amount of money that you have. And that's why we think these areas like social media and search and kind of software are probably a lot more competitive than people give them credit for.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eIt's interesting to dig into something that you almost said in passing there, Yuri. It feels like the ad dollars going to the Amazon and the Instacarts and the Ubers is because the advertisers know that there's at least a moment in that very precious thing that you identified, which is time. But there are eyeballs captive and concentrating, right? They're moving away from a social media tab or they're moving away from watching streaming or whatever it is we're doing to actually focus on that transaction and that point in time. So Yuri, when you look ahead, when you look into a crystal ball, and it's an unfair question, which is always the most fun kind of question, where do you see new platforms coming up in the tech space that are going to be successful in capturing my attention in yours? And perhaps it's not necessarily clear they're doing it yet. They may sneak up on us, but where do you have a sense that you've got some emerging players in that space?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK: \u003c/strong\u003eThat's really interesting. I mean, I think what's coming out of this conversation, at least in our minds when we analyze these markets, is one thing I can tell you for certain, there's something's gonna come, right? The disruption that happens in the tech sector, it's kind of synonymous with its kind of existence and its nature. So I don't know specifically what platforms are gonna come up, but they certainly will come up, right? So we've had a wave of virtual reality, right? That could be a new thing, right? Remember, the metaverse two years ago, everyone was talking about that. Now, I think these things always go through a hype cycle in technology, right? They get hyped up, everyone talks about it, gets excited. Usually a really bad ETF launch is related to it. And suddenly the excitement dies off and suddenly we... But the technology doesn't go away and people keep working on it and keep analyzing and keep thinking of new ways. And suddenly it's on the scene. And remember, this disruption keeps happening faster and faster, right? Take the example of chat GPT. Now, it took chat GPT five days to get to a million users, right? Instagram, for example, two and a half months to get to that same number. And if you look at historic kind of services or platforms, as you say, that are vying for our attention or our time or our use in the technology space, they're progressively getting faster and faster and faster in terms of how quickly they come and capture our imagination or our use. And that's the nature of the technology sector. That just doesn't happen anywhere else, right? No new railroad is gonna pop up in the US all of a sudden.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eWell, let's dig into that and go, let's go full circle here in the conversations as we close out together, which is to that point, $TOLL, the ETF that you and the team have put together specifically to find the winners where there are monopolistic or oligopolistic characteristics. If I look at your top 10 holdings, you don't have a lot of tech in there and you don't have any in your top five. So if we go back to those five sources of competitive or monopolistic advantage that you identified earlier, Yuri, again, network effects, switching costs, economies of scale, regulation, nonreplicable physical assets. I know you've written a blog about this. It feels like listening to you as though you can almost rank them in your mind, right? Because the technology of social media play that we discussed is very heavy on network effects, right? There's a huge amount of reliance on that for those monopolies. Am I hearing or furring that perhaps the nonreplicable physical assets Monopolies are sort of your favourite in that line up. Maybe regulations, is there a way that you order them? And again, I'm just trying to play back to you what I've heard in the course of our conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, absolutely. I mean, that's how we think about constructing monopolies. We always think, like, what are these sources? Can I identify these sources? And more importantly, are they really durable? And I think physical assets always is kind of the contrarian statement here, right? Because very few people associate technology with something physical in this world. But that's really where we are finding kind of the monopolistic businesses. So take, for example, semiconductor equipment manufacturing. These are companies that have spent a very long time developing some very, very advanced technology. And over time they've concentrated so that in certain processes within semiconductor manufacturing, there might be only two companies that do this in the whole world. In fact, it actually houses the one absolutely true monopoly that exists in technology, which is a Dutch company called ASML. Now, ASML builds the leading edge lithography machines for semiconductor manufacturing. And just to give you a sense of what this is. It's a four, three, four story machine. Okay, it's three to four stories high. It costs $300 million. It has a sphere of glass in it that if you were to blow it up to the size of the earth, it wouldn't have a dent less than sort of like one centimeter in it. It's like perfection of technology. And ASML is the only company in the whole world that can do this. It's taken it years to develop this stuff and it's selling it to its customers. It's a hundred percent monopolist in this space. But again, it's a physical thing that they've created and built. And that's why we think that that's an interesting area where there's not that much competition in the technology space. The other areas where you can combine the digital space with something tangible, like a support work, or as you said, regulation. So we quite like the tax preparation software space. You think that that's related to, you know, a technology, but actually to get taxed, you need a support network of individuals who are experts in tax. Over time, that support network is really what drives the value of that particular software and the competitive advantage versus any new entry that might come in. And that's where we think kind of the real, maybe gems, hidden gems in technology of monopolies are, and probably not in the...\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eThat's fascinating. Let's talk a little bit about that tax preparation one, because H\u0026amp;R Block, you know, would be an example of that, Uri, but this is also one where just to push you a little bit, the IRS has at least announced, we'll have to see how quickly it rolls out, that it wants to have its own e-filing, you know, and software offering out there to make it more accessible to taxpayers. Is that something, is that a scenario where you could almost say, oh, look, the regulator is disrupting the provider?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYK: \u003c/strong\u003eThat's really interesting because obviously one of the things that happens in monopolistic type industries, which tax preparation, there's only a few players actually, the one we own is Intuit, not H\u0026amp;R Block. And H\u0026amp;R Block is a bit more in the old world of actual physical tax preparation in terms of people going into offices, which we think the best. Exactly. It is a support network, but there's no technology attached to it. So for me, what I like about Intuit is you have the technology of tax preparation, but you also have a call center and real support helping people prepare these taxes. The IRS, so governments is something we have to watch very carefully always in the monopolistic space because one, governments often don't like monopoly power. Now, all the monopolies that we invest in, sometimes they get, you know, people think that they're bad, but the truth is they've arisen because they've given a lot of value to customers over time. And if we pick the right ones, they're the ones that have not necessarily taken a huge cut of this particular value and the customers have accrued most of it. The IRS obviously looks at this and says, well, Intuits created a ton of value for people to prepare their taxes, but we think there should be a, you know, the government should also allow easy filing because we have all of the information. Then there was a bill passed, some money was spent on this and investigate the report. It's expensive for them to create that system. There's a lot of political, like, fighting over this particular thing, because in general in the United States, there's a view that the government, it's taking your taxes. Should it really be telling you how you file your taxes as well? So it's a big political divide. And so in general, what I see there is quite a limited risk. They already have free filing. So for individuals who have very simple tax returns, they can file for free with the IRS anyway. Exactly. And so the question is, why? And it's not like tax preparation software is that expensive. It's a couple hundred dollars. So is it really worth the government's resources? And what's happened is that you've seen the IRS bill actually defund this particular area. So the risk is starting to go away.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAB: \u003c/strong\u003eInteresting. So many interesting insights coming out of this conversation.

I'm your host Kinsey Grant and today's show is brought to you by Tema ETFs and joining us as today's guest is Chris Seminec. He's an investor partner at Tema ETFs, and they're an issuer focused on bottom-up investing in unique structural themes like the one that I'm sure we will talk about today in this conversation. The RSHO ETF, that's the ticker R-S-H-O, excuse me, is one that we're gonna talk a lot about today because we are talking about reshoring, which is a really interesting practice that is certainly derived from a lot of macroeconomic and geopolitical realities that we're facing today and is something that is certainly an interesting force in the economy and in the investing world. So Chris, welcome to the Public Podcast. I'm excited to talk about this with you today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChris Semenuk: \u003c/strong\u003eHi, Kinsey. Thanks for having me on.\\\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eOf course, of course. So I want to start here with some big-picture stuff. When we think about bringing more jobs to the United States or bolstering the economy, the domestic economy, it seems like a relatively simple thing to do in theory. But you and I both know that in practice, it's likely much more complicated than just bringing more jobs here and bolstering the economy. Especially in the light of the last few years, we had what I think many of us would kind of consider a supply chain breakdown in 2020, shortly after the onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic. We've been seeing this transition from more international supply chains to more domestic ones. But I would love to hear a little bit in the big picture about how you would define this reality, this part of the economy, the global economy that might be focused on this practice of reshoring. Tell me a little bit about what reshoring is and how we see those forces at play right now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCS: \u003c/strong\u003eGreat. So reshoring, when you read about it in the newspapers, I think can be defined most simply as just companies that are locating or bringing production from overseas back to the shores of the United States. But I think it's really important for investors to step back for a minute because what that is, is the result of, you know, reshoring is a result of a process that has started a few years ago, a few years back, which is essentially that companies are number one unwinding a lot of the unintended exposures that resulted from essentially 20 or 30 years of globalization. What I mean by these sort of exposures are when they located production from shores of the US to overseas to take advantage of low-cost labor, they ended up incurring that resulted from essentially 20 or 30 years of globalization. And what I mean by these sort of exposures are, when they located production from shores of the US to overseas to take advantage of low-cost labor, they ended up incurring or ended up getting exposed to certain vulnerabilities and certain exposures by having their production located or ended up getting exposed to certain vulnerabilities and certain exposures by having their production located five, six thousand miles away. So reshoring is, I think, a response or, as I said, an unwinding of those vulnerabilities or unintended consequences of globalization. Now there are two other trends going on at the same time, and one of them is that during this time of globalization, which really started back during 2000, which was when China entered WTO. Over that 20 years of globalization, that search for low-cost labor, I think companies in the US neglected their manufacturing base here in the US. And I think we're now finding out that companies are aware of that primarily because of what happened during the pandemic and also what happened as it relates to a number of the global to a number of the global conflicts and wars that have taken place in recent years. So reshoring is a trend that's been in place, I think, for years, even though a lot of people assume it was a response to the pandemic or to global conflict. Now there's a third underlying trend and conflicts and wars that have taken place in recent years. So reshoring is a trend that's been in place, I think, for years, even though a lot of people assume it was a response to the pandemic or to global conflict. Now there's a third underlying trend, and that is that the US government is now spending or is now writing a check that represents the largest value in terms of industrial policy in history. And what the government is trying to do is, in my mind, essentially crowd in private investment here in the U.S. to essentially address that neglected industrial manufacturing infrastructure that was sort of left behind over the last 20 years as U.S. corporates looked outside the shores of the U.S. for production is in my mind essentially crowd in private investment here in the US to essentially address that neglected industrial manufacturing structure that was sort of left behind over the last 20 years as US corporates looked outside of the shores of the US for production.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, that certainly makes a lot of sense, and I appreciate the context especially to illustrate that this is not something that is just a post-2020 reality, right? That reshoring and globalization been forces that have been at play for quite some time. Now, before we get into some of those, the kind of next phase of what comes after this reshoring trend here, I would love to talk a little bit about the vulnerabilities of globalization that you mentioned. What might some of those vulnerabilities be? And in what case and at what point might those vulnerabilities be encourage a company to engage in some reshoring to bring production or to bring industry back to the United States? Tell me a little bit about how that plays out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCS: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so I think a lot of investors conflate reshoring as a company's defensive move as it relates to events that have essentially highlighted the vulnerabilities and exposures that have resulted from globalization. So there are indeed cases where companies or manufacturers are moving production or parts of production back to the US as a sort of defensive measure. That said, though, there are also examples of companies that are taking an offensive approach to reshoring. And so it's not just manufacturing. It can be a retailer, for example, that wants to locate some of its production here in the US. And they see it as an offensive measure, meaning you're closer to your customers, your design is closer to your manufacturing. And when those two factors are in place, you can have quicker product cycles, but also more product cycles. And ultimately that just results in more growth. So reshoring is not only defensive, but it's also an offensive move for companies. But broadly speaking, we're taking a very active approach to the theme. And I think that's really important for investors to keep in mind. Reshoring is not a one size fits all positive on every company that does it. And as I said, it's both defensive and offensive. Not only that, but reshoring is not only the company, the reshoring opportunity is not only companies that are moving manufacturing, but it's companies that are supplying to those people, to those companies and companies that are support services to those companies as well. And I think it's really in those areas, not, you know, it's not just about the caterpillars or the large manufacturers that you read about in the headlines of the newspapers every day it's actually about the more smaller medium-cap businesses that are kind of being pulled along with those manufacturers who are going to have to set up supply chains, support services here in the US that they didn't have before, and that's going to create underlying demand for businesses that I think a lot of people don't necessarily think about, and it's why we started the fund because we think those are opportunities we want to get in that are kind of being pulled along with those manufacturers who are going to have to set up supply chains, support services here in the US that he didn't have before. And that's gonna create underlying demand for businesses that I think a lot of people don't necessarily think about. And it's why we started the fund because we think those are opportunities we wanna give.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eIt's also the orders of magnitude of like impact that they have on all sorts of other companies and businesses and even investing themes as well. Now, one thing that I do want to get your perspective on before we dig in more to the ETF, because I am interested to hear more about how that works and you know what you're doing over there. One thing is this idea of the balancing act that companies are always continuously having to engage in. When we're talking about reshoring specifically or globalization, even more broadly,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCS: \u003c/strong\u003eWe're talking about corporations that have to think about the timeline of their product cycles. They also have to think about labor costs. They also have to think about economic headwinds and all sorts of impacts in the economy, globally speaking. But they also do have to consider geopolitical tensions. You mentioned that there are companies that are engaging in reshoring as both offense and defense. But I am curious about how geopolitical tensions, especially with China, might impact American companies making a decision to engage in restoring.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eThis is something that has always kind of been heating up, it's always what people use those two words to describe tensions between the United States and China. But we saw that China is taking all their pandas back from the rest of the world. They were seeing some headlines now. So I'm curious to hear your perspective on how that plays into this larger conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCS: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so again, I think a lot of investors and people that sort of watch this space sort of immediately link this as a kind of US versus China issue. As I said, it's not really that. It's really an unwinding of some unintended negative consequences of globalization. Look, it took 20 years for us to kind of get into this situation. It'll take us decades to kind of unwind some of these unwanted practices. You're right. I mean, at the moment, or at least if you look back since China entered WTO, it's been pretty much a bipolar manufacturing world. We've had the US on one side and we've had China on the other. And I think what we're witnessing now is in some ways, a kind of effort by both sides to sort of reduce this sort of economic interdependence on one another. And I think Jake Sullivan, who has been very vocal as part of the current administration, now is in some ways. It's interesting that the administration puts the National Security Advisor in front of the public when talking about American manufacturing and his whole sort of focus is initially on critical areas or areas of say national security. So that's why the first wave of reshoring focused on EV batteries, on semiconductors, on pharmaceuticals. As I said, from an investment opportunity standpoint, there are opportunities there. Those companies that make those products are kind of making the reshoring journey. But beyond that, as I said, there's a whole world of the kind of picks and shovels, if you will, that people will need to use. And I think those picks and shovels will be enormous investment opportunities that I think, again, can only be uncovered using an active process. But as I said, we're moving from this sort of bipolar manufacturing world to a multipolar world. And I think that multipolar world involves not only sort of Mexico, but it involves companies moving out of China into and around the regions of China, India, Mexico, Bangladesh. But broadly speaking, you know, the fund is focused on businesses that are relocating manufacturing back to the US. We do own some foreign companies. In the cases there are companies like ABB, the Swiss company that makes a lot of electrical utility equipment. They have specifically said that they want to take advantage of the spending that the US government is putting in place in these incentives. So they are actually, in terms of their total capital investment, increasing it the most in the US in terms of their manufacturing footprint. f their total capital investment increasing at the most in the US in terms of manufacturing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eMakes sense, yeah. I think within the idea of this as an investment opportunity, which is something we've kind of touched on a little bit here, I would love to hear more about the $RSHO ETF. You mentioned that it's investing in companies that are engaging in reshoring. But tell me a little bit about the premise beyond that and how it might fit into investors' portfolios, especially those who might be listening today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCS: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so investors should see the American Reshoring Fund as, well, what it is, is about 31 companies. And the common thread that runs through every one of these companies is that they are, as we define, high quality. So high quality for us means business that generates net-free cash flow throughout the business cycle and is able to use that free cash flow and reinvest it at competitive rates of return. And then also what they don't use, pay it back to shareholders who buybacks and dividends. So if you strip away the reshoring theme of the fund, what an investor is essentially left with is, as I said, a collection of very high quality cashflow generating businesses. And when you layer on the reshoring theme, these businesses are essentially getting a tailwind of demand that we think will last at least, as I said, it took more than a couple of decades for us to kind of get into this predicament where we have vulnerable supply chains, it'll take at least a couple of decades to get out. And as a result, we think this is a very durable investment theme that we think will play out over years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eRight. And for investors who are listening to this, can you explain the relevance of this idea of durability in a portfolio, especially for people who are interested in buying and holding?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCS: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so these, as I said, these are businesses that have shown a propensity to create shareholder value historically. So I think it's really important for investors when they think about the theme, as I said, it fits into a core equity strategy. These are just simply very high quality, in some cases, manufacturing businesses, in some cases, service companies that I think an investor would look at anyway. And as I said, what we've tried to do is say, okay, we've got this collection of high quality businesses that generate free cash, that generate competitive ROIC. Where are we in this portfolio in terms of businesses that intersect with this secular tailwind of demand that, as I said, I think will last years in the making? So, you know, again, the American manufacturing footprint used to be regarded as sort of the leader in the world. you know, back in the sort of 70s. And, you know, we relinquished that during the period of globalization. But I think the administration, the government, is in support of kind of rebuilding the American infrastructure. They're putting money behind it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eCompanies recognize the benefits of it. And the durability of the trend, I think, will be at least a couple of decades in the making. Okay. And how has this reinvestment in American manufacturing panned out? I mean, obviously this idea of, this is a long-term conversation, it's years in the making, but so far, how's it been?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCS: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, so the fund launched in May and performance has been excellent. I think what we're seeing is that the businesses in the portfolio, as I said, are very high quality in nature in terms of their ability to generate free cash and invest at a high ROIC. Now, what's happened is that post the pandemic, when we've had customers and customers of the manufacturing complex. ordering two and three times what they thought they would get because we had supply chain shortages. A lot of the companies that we own in the portfolio that are manufacturing related didn't hire headcount to address that. So, as I said, as we kind of move forward going through this economic uncertain period that we're moving into with high interest rates and threat of recession, all of the companies in the portfolio are still running very lean because they didn't over hire back in sort of 21 as we exited the pandemic. So I think as and when this sort of recovery starts to pick up again in 2024, the businesses in the fund that we're invested in, I think, stand to actually over earn going forward as their revenues start to regrow again. And keep in mind that at the moment, many of the companies in the portfolio right now have backlogs that are almost double and triple what they were before they went into the pandemic. And these backlogs are still, you know, I think stand to actually over earn going forward as their revenues start to regrow again. And they keep it double and triple what they were before they went into the pandemic. And these backlogs are still, you know, too excellent what they were and are taking some time to work off. So the fact is, even if we go into a recession, these backlogs may allow these companies to continue to grow straight through a recession and then come out the air of the sun and continue growing as the economy eventually improves. So the fact is, even if we go into a recession, these backlogs may allow these companies to continue to grow straight through a recession and then come out the other side and continue with growing as the economy eventually improves again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKG: \u003c/strong\u003eMakes sense to me.
