<p>If the recent trends in sports card prices have sent you digging in your childhood closet for your old collection, you might now be asking yourself: are my cards worth anything?</p>
<p>In order for your card to be worth any money, in most cases youll need to send it in for grading. This is not a trivial task or costespecially now that these services have been paused due to an extreme backlog. Wed recommend that you get a basic grasp on how sports card grading works to determine if its worth it. </p>

<p>The primary goal of grading is to ensure card authenticity, but grades can also make or break the card&rsquo;s value. As many now know, even a half grade can make the difference of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>With sports card collecting transitioning into quite a valuable hobby, the establishment of sports card grading companies became necessary to establish a level playing field for collectors. To remain unbiased, third-party grading companies cant hold any monetary stakes in collectors graded cards. Thus, these companies could provide a reliable and trustworthy source of authority.</p>
<p>Before sports card grading, collectors used to purchase raw cards with a grain of salt. With the rise of grading, raw cards are now less reliable to collectors and viewed as less valuable. Thats because after a sports card receives a grade, its encapsulated in a cardholder, which prevents the card from damageincluding from anyone trying to tamper with the card.</p>
<p>Through the years, collectors have grown comfortable with sports card grading, and card grading standards have become more familiar. Sports cards grading gives assurance to collectors that their cards will have a greater likelihood of retaining long-term value, both via the authoritative grade and the physical protection from the cardholder encapsulation.</p>
</div><div class="entry-content"><p><html></p>
<h2 id="how-sports-cards-are-graded">How Sports Cards Are Graded</h2>
<p>PSA and BGS are two sports and trading card grading companies that use a standard 1-10 scale. In addition, BGS also uses the 9.5 half point. PSA avoids this. PSA grading fees quickly exceed BGS grading fees. Both models increase in price with tier, but PSA has more premium-priced tiers.</p>
<p>You may be wondering how exactly grading companies grade these sports cardsits quite simple! Each card receives a numeric grade ranging from 1-10, with 10 signifying the highest attainable grade. Depending on the card grading company and the circumstances, half-grades may apply.</p>
<p>The numeric grade is based on four categories: centering, corners, edges, and surface. A higher numerical grade indicates a more pristine card. Lower graded cards will show centering concerns, printing defects, and wear of edges and corners.</p>
<p>10 is the highest overall grade a sports card can receive, though <a href="https://www.beckett.com/news/introducing-bgs-black/" rel="nofollow">BGS also offers a Black Label Pristine 10</a>, which means the card received a 10 for all four subgrades. While a Black Label Pristine 10 and PSA 10 are the highest grades a card can obtain, other grades are still valuable.</p>
<div style="margin-bottom: -30px"> </div>

	<img width="176" height="300" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/sweet-caporal.jpeg" class="attachment-medium size-medium" alt="Sweet Caporal 1909-1991 T206 Honus Wagner card" loading="lazy" decoding="async" /><figcaption><p style="text-align: center;font-size: 12px;color: gray">Source: <a href="https://www.psacard.com/articles/articleview/10473/multimillion-dollar-psa-authentic-t-206-honus-wagner-card-arrives-scp-auctions">PSA</a></p></figcaption></figure><div class="entry-content"><p><html></p>
<div style="margin-top: -30px"> </div>
<p>Typically for modern cards, a grade of a 9 or 10 is paramount because recently released cards should maintain pristine condition. On the other hand, vintage cards can have low grades like a 2 or 3 and still be worth millions of dollars, such as a <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/famed-honus-wagner-t206-baseball-card-sells-for-new-record-at-3-7-million/#:~:text=On%20Saturday%2C%20a%20Honus%20Wagner,expensive%20card%20of%20all%20time." rel="nofollow">1909-1991 T206 Honus Wagner card</a>. Because the T206 set was issued over 100 years ago, there is a strong likelihood that the highest overall condition of a card from that era only merits a PSA/BGS 2 or 3.</p>
<p>The value of a graded sports card comes down to <strong>condition and scarcity</strong>. A card with a high population and a high percentage of cards graded in pristine condition may not be as valuable as a card with a high population but low percentage of cards in pristine condition.</p>
<p>On the flip side, a card with a low population and a high percentage of cards graded in pristine condition may not be as valuable as a card with a low population but a low percentage of cards graded in pristine condition.</p>
<h3 id="centering">Centering</h3>
<p>The perception of centering is crucial in the field of sports cards. While all categories are equally important when obtaining a grade, the centering of a card is vital if you elect to sell the card in the future, as poor centering may not provide as much value.</p>
<p>A grading card company will only give a 10 if the card is almost perfectly centered. When a card grader looks at centering, they divide up the card as left/right and top/bottom to measure what percentage of the card is off-centered. A perfectly centered card measures 50/50 (meaning 50% of the card lies on the left/right side, and 50% lies on the top/bottom).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.psacard.com/resources/gradingstandards" rel="nofollow">According to PSAs grading standards</a> for a PSA 10, the front of the card must measure between 55/45 to 60/40 and 70/30 on the reverse. <a href="https://www.beckett.com/grading/scale" rel="nofollow">BGS presents even less leeway, as a BGS 10 requires 50/50 on the cards face and 60/40 on the back</a>.</p>
<p>Before sending a card for grading, collectors can apply the <a href="https://www.newegg.com/p/0E8-05UH-00006" rel="nofollow">Original GradeMaster Card Centering Tool</a>, enabling collectors to measure the centering of their sports cards.</p>
<h3 id="corners">Corners</h3>
<p>The fraying of the corners for raw sports cards is inevitable over time. With the proper storing of sports cards, and in particular having a card graded, collectors can prolong their collections.</p>
<p>A card may appear to have pristine corners to the naked eye, but card grading companies examine the card under magnification to warrant the condition. Both PSA and BGS require perfect corners for a card to receive a grade of 10.</p>
<h3 id="edges">Edges</h3>
<p>Like corners, the edges of sports cards are prone to deterioration. The edges are predisposed to chipping, which exposes white borders on the card. For a card to earn a 10, the edges of a card must be flawless to the naked eye and virtually perfect when looked at under magnification.</p>
<h3 id="surface">Surface</h3>
<p>The final criteria looked at by card graders is the surface of the card. A cards surface is susceptible to loss of glossiness, wax stains, scratching, and printing defects. Sports cards are highly sensitive to surface deterioration.</p>

<p>Before the Beckett Grading Services, <a href="https://www.beckett.com/about-us" rel="nofollow">James Beckett III</a>, a prolific statistician, tirelessly tracked the baseball card market, producing the industrys most recognized baseball card price guide in 1979. Following the success of Becketts price guides, Beckett Media emerged as the face of collectibles.</p>
<p>Like PSA, <a href="https://www.beckett.com/grading/compare-our-services" rel="nofollow">Beckett has subdivisions to Beckett Grading Services</a>. In 2001, Beckett announced Beckett Vintage Grading (BVG), catering to vintage sports cards pre-1981. If youre into sports card shows, you should capitalize on Becketts Raw Card Review. Beckett organizes a booth at card shows and gives collectors an in-depth review of their cards while presenting what cards collectors should obtain when submitting to BGS or BVG. Whats more, Beckett offers Beckett Authentication, providing collectors with certification for autographed memorabilia.</p>
<h2 id="psa-vs-bgs-labels">PSA vs. BGS Labels</h2>
<p>When PSA and BGS grade a sports card, the card is encapsulated in a tamper-evident holder with a label that provides collectors with specific information regarding the cards condition, authenticity, and uniqueness. While both grading companies present the player, card manufacturer, grade, and unique barcode, the two slabs differ significantly.</p>

Like a standard bank check, fugitive ink will wash away if any cleaning products compromise the card. A PSA label also unveils Lighthouse technology, creating a holographic effect that reveals PSAs logo. The reverse of PSAs label showcases a PSA Lighthouse logo and a QR Code.

A gold label is issued for a BGS 10 and 9.5, a silver label for a BGS 9 and 8.5, and the remaining graded cards feature a white label.</p>
<p>Differing from PSA, the front of a BGS graded card provides the numerical grade for each of the four subgrades of a card. Many collectors feel that the subgrades of BGS help give a better sense of the card without needing to see the asset in real life.</p>
<h3 id="psa-bgs-autograph-grading">PSA &amp; BGS Autograph Grading</h3>
<p>As strictly an autograph authentication service, <a href="https://www.psacard.com/about/psa" rel="nofollow">PSA launched PSA/DNA in 1998</a>, focusing on authenticating autographs and memorabilia.

<p>PSAs Autograph Encapsulation allows collectors to submit autographed cards, photographs, among other collectible items, to become graded and encapsulated with a numeric grade. One of the perks of this service provides collectors with an alternative to the traditional certificate of authenticity, though youll receive a COA as well.</p>
<p>Last but not least, PSA offers its customers Card and Autograph Dual Grading. With this approach, collectors can submit an autographed sports trading card to PSA and receive a grade for both the card and autograph. PSA uses their traditional 1-10 grading scale for autographs, determined by the overall quality of the signature.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.beckett-authentication.com/" rel="nofollow">BGS also offers an authentication service for autographs, termed Beckett Authentication Services (BAS)</a>. BAS provides collectors with expert grading for all genres of autographs, from vintage to modern sports autographs, together with the entertainment and historical disciplines.</p>
<p>BGS graders use expert analysis <a href="https://www.beckett-authentication.com/services/authentication" rel="nofollow">to analyze the signature and the ink of memorabilia</a>. When an autograph is deemed authentic, the item receives a tamper-evident label and a BAS Certification Number on top of a COA. When a verified autograph is recorded in Becketts online database, collectors can enter their certification or serial number to maintain a record of authenticity.</p>

<h2 id="how-much-does-psa-bgs-cost">How Much Does PSA &amp; BGS Cost?</h2>
<p>Before jumping into the expense of sports card grading, its essential to r<a href="https://www.psacard.com/resources/faq" rel="nofollow">eview the concept of the declared value</a> and how it affects the submission process and cost of grading. The declared value is essentially the appraised value of a card after being successfully submitted and graded by PSA or BGS. Depending on the anticipated declared value, a collector will pay for grading based on specific tiers. The specific tiers vary in declared value, pricing, and turnaround time.</p>
<p>A collector uses the declared value to estimate the condition of their card and estimate what grade they expect to receive after the card is graded. To help collectors through the process, both PSA and BGS have tools to determine a cards value. PSA has a <a href="https://www.psacard.com/smrpriceguide" rel="nofollow">Sports Market Report</a> Price Guide, <a href="https://www.psacard.com/auctionprices" rel="nofollow">Auctions Prices Realized</a>, and a comprehensive <a href="https://www.psacard.com/pop" rel="nofollow">population report</a>. BGS has an in-depth <a href="https://www.beckett.com/grading/pop-report" rel="nofollow">population report</a> and a graded <a href="https://www.beckett.com/grading/card-lookup" rel="nofollow">Card Lookup</a> to help determine the value of a card.</p>
<p>On occasion, a card receives a grade higher than its declared value. In this case, PSA and BGS may request a higher fee from collectors. However, the declared value is in position in the unlikely event that your card has an issue, and PSA or BGS has to provide collectors with the card&rsquo;s replacement value. With too low of a declared value, collectors will have less protection for their cards. With the appropriate declared value, the submitter and grading company are both protected.</p>

<h2 id="is-psa-grading-or-bgs-grading-worth-it">Is PSA Grading or BGS Grading worth it?</h2>
<p>The concept of grading sports cards is to ensure authenticity and increase the value of a card. Though, not all sports cards are worth grading. Concerning the long-term value of sports cards, grading is only worth it for cards that will carry more money after being graded by PSA or BGS. Grading sports cards are a costly endeavor, especially now with just thin service options available from PSA and BGS. If your card isnt worth more than the value of the service fees of grading, then you shouldnt grade that particular sports card.</p>
<p>Also, remember that condition is at the core of the value of the card. While a graded sports card will typically carry more value than a raw sports card, its imperative to research your cards to discern if having a card graded will ultimately increase the cards value.</p>
</p>
<h3 id="latest-announcements">Latest Announcements</h3>
<p>Before the coronavirus pandemic, PSA encountered more submissions than ever, leading to extensive delays and a backlog of ungraded sports cards. <a href="https://blog.psacard.com/2020/06/25/psa-and-covid-19-dealing-with-a-pandemic/" rel="nofollow">In March 2020, the pandemic forced PSA to shut down their New Jersey and California facilities</a>.</p>
<p>With an excess of cards, PSA suspended Value, Economy, and Regular submissions. PSA currently offers Express service for $200/card, Super Express for $300/card, and Walkthrough for $600/card. If your card has a declared value of over $1,000, PSA offers Premium options that take just one business day, though $1,000/card is far from nickels and dimes.</p>
<p>While PSA no longer offers turnaround time, they implemented <a href="https://blog.psacard.com/2021/06/10/psa-explains-complete-through-dates-and-batch-fifo/" rel="nofollow">Call Through Dates (CTD)</a>. These CTD&rsquo;s are a way for collectors to discern where PSA stands in their fulfillment of graded cards by service level. To contend with the backlog, <a href="https://blog.psacard.com/2020/12/09/more-submissions-require-more-employees-more-space/" rel="nofollow">PSA continues to hire more customer service personnel</a> and unveiled the <a href="https://blog.psacard.com/2021/05/20/psa-unveils-the-customer-request-center/" rel="nofollow">Customer Request Center</a>, aiming to streamline the customer service of PSA.</p>
<p>Facing a similar situation, Beckett also faces a backlog of cards. As of June 7, 2021, Beckett suspended all grading services other than their Premium Level. <a href="https://www.beckett.com/news/jeromy-murray-named-president-of-beckett-collectibles/" rel="nofollow">Jeromy Murray, named Becketts President earlier this year</a>, set the target date of July 28, the start of the 41st National Sports Collectors Convention in Chicago, to process, grade, and return the bulk of customers cards.</p>
<p>But as it stands, Becketts Economy, Standard, and Express Level services remain suspended. The only passage for collectors to have a card graded by Beckett is to dish out $250 for their Premium Level service. We could only hope that Beckett issues an announcement soon about the backlog and when to expect the entryway to additional service levels and faster turnaround time.</p>
</p>
<h3 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h3>
<p>The grading of sports cards remains in place to ensure authenticity and increase the value of sports cards. Since the appearance of sports card grading companies in the 80s, the sports card market has advanced and become an attractive alternative investment.</p>
<p>Despite PSA and Becketts services remaining suspended, perhaps we should view the extensive delays as evidence of furthering the sports card landscape. Maybe we should use this time to reflect on the evolution of sports cards and anticipate a promising future.</p>

Public Investing is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Public Holdings, Inc. (“Public Holdings”). This is not an offer, solicitation of an offer, or advice to buy or sell securities or open a brokerage account in any jurisdiction where Public Investing is not registered. Securities products offered by Public Investing are not FDIC insured. Apex Clearing Corporation, our clearing firm, has additional insurance coverage in excess of the regular <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a> limits.

<p>
<b>Options.</b><br />
Options trading entails significant risk and is not suitable for all investors. Options investors can rapidly lose the value of their investment in a short period of time and incur permanent loss by expiration date. Certain complex options strategies carry additional risk and costs. Investors must read and understand the <a href="https://www.theocc.com/company-information/documents-and-archives/options-disclosure-document">Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options</a> before considering any options transaction. Index options have special features and fees that should be carefully considered, including settlement, exercise, expiration, tax, and cost characteristics. See <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/fee-schedule">Fee Schedule</a> for all options trading fees.  Supporting documentation for any claims will be furnished upon request. To learn more about options rebates, see terms of the <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/rebate-terms">Options Rebate Program</a>. Rebate rates vary monthly from $0.06-$0.18 and depend on your current and prior month’s options trading volume. Rates are subject to change at any time.</p>
<p>
<b>Bonds.</b><br />
“Bonds” shall refer to corporate debt securities and U.S. government securities offered on the Public platform through a self-directed brokerage account held at Public Investing and custodied at Apex Clearing.  For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude  treasury securities held in  treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “Treasury Accounts” section.</p>
<p>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors.  The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa.  Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk.  All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change.  Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond's credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned.  Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.</p>
<p><em>A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond. Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/fee-schedule">Fee Schedule</a></em>.</p>

<em>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account.  The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</em></p>
<p><em>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages.

<p><b id="disclosures-etf-etp">ETFs & ETPs.</b><br />
Before investing in an ETF, you should read the prospectus carefully, which provides detailed information on the fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses and unique risk profile. Prospectuses can be found on the ETF issuer's website.  All investments involve risks, including the loss of principal. Performance data represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate such that an investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost.</p>
<p>A spot bitcoin exchange-traded product (“ETP”) is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) and is not subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (the “CEA”). As a result, shareholders do not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the 1940 Act or the protections afforded by the CEA.  The performance of a spot bitcoin ETP will not reflect the specific return an investor would realize if the investor actually purchased bitcoin. Investors will not have any rights that bitcoin holders have and will not have the right to receive any redemption proceeds in bitcoin.  Digital assets like Bitcoin are highly speculative and may be subject to increased risk of price volatility, illiquidity, market manipulation, and loss, including loss of your entire investment.</p>
<p>
<b>Margin Accounts.</b><br />
Margin investing increases your level of risk and has the potential to magnify your losses, including loss of more than your initial investment.   Please assess your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial circumstances to determine whether margin is appropriate for you.  You must repay your margin debt regardless of the underlying value of the securities you purchased.  Public Investing can change its maintenance margin requirements at any time without prior notice.  If the equity in your margin account falls below the minimum maintenance requirements, you may be required to deposit additional cash or securities.  If you are unable to do so, Public Investing may sell some or all of your securities, without prior approval or notice.  You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call.  For more information please see Public Investing’s <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/margin-disclosure-statement">Margin Disclosure Statement</a>, <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/apex-margin-agreement">Margin Agreement</a>, and <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/fee-schedule">Fee Schedule</a>.</p>

<b id="disclosures-hyca">High-Yield Cash Account.</b><br />
A High-Yield Cash Account is a secondary brokerage account with Public Investing. Funds in your High-Yield Cash Account are automatically deposited into partner banks (“Partner Banks”), where that cash earns interest and is eligible for FDIC insurance. See <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/high-yield-account/partners-list">here</a> for a list of current Partner Banks. Your Annual Percentage Yield is variable and may change at the discretion of the Partner Banks or Public Investing. Apex Clearing and Public Investing receive administrative fees for operating this program, which reduce the amount of interest paid on swept cash.  Neither Public Investing nor any of its affiliates is a bank. <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/high-yield-account">Learn more</a>.</p>

<b>Cryptocurrency.</b><br />
Cryptocurrency trading, execution, and custody services are provided by Bakkt Crypto Solutions, LLC (NMLS ID 1828849) (“Bakkt”).

<b id="disclosures-treasuries">Treasury Accounts.</b><br />
Investing services in treasury accounts offering 6 month US Treasury Bills on the Public platform are through Jiko Securities, Inc. (“JSI”), a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>.

JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity).  T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.”  Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash.  The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity.  T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance.  Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk.  As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates.  Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment. <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/jiko-treasuries-risk-disclosure" target="_blank">Jiko U.S. Treasuries Risk Disclosures</a> for further details.</p>
