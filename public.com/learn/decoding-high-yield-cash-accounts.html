<h2 id="what-are-high-yield-cash-accounts">What Are High-Yield Cash Accounts?</h2>
<p>High-yield cash accounts (HYCA) are financial instruments that offer a significantly higher interest rate compared to traditional savings accounts. They function as dependable places for investors to hold cash but with the added benefit of earning more interest. These accounts are typically offered by banks, credit unions, and online financial institutions, and they stand out for their higher Annual Percentage Yield (APY).</p>
<p>For financial portfolios, high-yield cash accounts serve a dual purpose. Firstly, they act as a reliable repository for cash reserves, offering stability and easy access to funds. Secondly, they provide an opportunity to earn a higher return on cash holdings, which can be particularly beneficial in periods of low-interest rates. This makes them an attractive option for investors looking to maintain liquidity while still earning some income from their cash assets.</p>
<p>When compared with other cash options like traditional savings accounts, money market accounts, or certificates of deposit (CDs), high-yield cash accounts often offer a more favorable balance between accessibility and potential returns. Unlike CDs, which may have longer lock-in periods, or traditional savings accounts, which typically offer lower interest rates, HYCAs aim to provide higher interest rates while maintaining liquidity. This combination is especially valuable for investors who desire immediate access to their funds while still maximizing their earning potential.</p>

<h2 id="mechanics-of-high-yield-cash-accounts">Mechanics of High-Yield Cash Accounts</h2>
<p>High-Yield Cash Accounts (HYCA) work by offering higher interest rates on deposited funds compared to standard savings accounts. Financial institutions may offer these elevated rates typically because they may have lower overhead costs, especially in the case of online banks, or they may invest deposited funds in a diversified portfolio of assets with a focus on capital preservation and income generation. The interest accrued on these accounts is usually compounded daily and paid out monthly, allowing the account balance to grow faster due to the compounding effect.</p>
<p>When it comes to safety, HYCAs are generally considered relatively secure, especially when provided by <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/" rel="nofollow">FDIC-insured banks</a> or<a href="https://ncua.gov/consumers/share-insurance-coverage" rel="nofollow"> NCUA-insured credit unions</a>, which typically offer insurance coverage of up to $250,000 per account. This insurance means that even if the bank or credit union fails, the deposited funds up to the specified limit are protected. However, it&rsquo;s important to note that while the principal is protected, the interest rate risk remains, as rates can fluctuate based on market conditions.</p>
<p>The credit risk associated with HYCAs is typically low, particularly if they are offered by well-established and highly rated financial institutions. However, investors should conduct due diligence and consider the institution&rsquo;s credit rating and financial stability before opening an account; these factors can impact the overall risk level.</p>
<p>The interest rates on high-yield cash accounts are usually variable, meaning they can change over time based on prevailing economic conditions and central bank policies. The Annual Percentage Yield (APY) is a key factor for investors to consider, as it reflects the actual rate of return that will be earned on the account. It accounts for the effect of compounding interest.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s crucial for investors to understand that the APY can fluctuate, which means the attractiveness of an HYCA may vary with changing interest rates. While the initial offered rate might be high, it&rsquo;s important to monitor the rate regularly to ensure it remains competitive. Some financial institutions may offer a promotional rate for a limited period, after which the APY may decrease.</p>

<h2 id="exploring-variations-in-cash-investment-options">Exploring Variations in Cash Investment Options</h2>
<p>For cash investment options, it&rsquo;s crucial to understand the differences between various types, such as Treasury accounts and High-Yield Cash Accounts (HYCA). Each comes with its own set of features, risks, and benefits, catering to different investor needs and risk appetites.</p>
<h3 id="treasury-account">Treasury Account</h3>
<p>Treasury accounts represent investments in government securities, offering a blend of safety and steady returns.</p>

	<ul class="list list-inline">
	<li>
		<p><strong id="distinguishing-features" class="skip-index">Distinguishing Features:</strong> Treasury accounts involve investing in government securities, such as treasury bills (<a href="https://public.com/learn/how-to-buy-us-treasury-bills">T-bills</a>), bonds, and notes. These are debt instruments issued by the government to fund its operations and projects. The main attraction of treasury accounts is their reliability, as they are backed by the full faith and credit of the government.</p>
	</li>


	<li>
		<p><strong id="risks" class="skip-index">Risks:</strong> The risks associated with treasury accounts are generally lower compared to other investment types. The primary risk is interest rate risk; if interest rates rise, the market value of existing treasury securities usually falls. </p>
	</li>


	<li>
		<p><strong id="benefits" class="skip-index">Benefits:</strong> Treasury accounts offer a reliable investment option with predictable returns. They are particularly appealing during times of economic uncertainty or market volatility. Additionally, certain types of treasury securities offer <a href="https://public.com/learn/how-are-treasury-bills-taxed">tax advantages</a>, such as being exempt from state and local taxes.

	<p>A High-Yield Cash Account is a secondary brokerage account with Open to the Public Investing, Inc. (“Public Investing”). Funds in your High-Yield Cash Account are swept to partner banks (“Partner Banks”), where that cash earns interest. See here for a list of current Partner Banks. Neither Public Investing nor any of its affiliates is a bank.<br />
Neither Public Investing nor any of its affiliates is a bank.<br />
As of 09/19/2024, the Annual Percentage Yield (APY) that you will receive on cash swept to Partner Banks is 4.6%. Your APY is variable and may change without notice at the discretion of the Partner Banks or Public Investing. Interest rates are determined by what Partner Banks are willing to pay, less administrative fees paid to Public Investing and Apex Clearing Corporation, our clearing firm.  Interest is earned only on swept funds in your High-Yield Cash Account, which is a separate account from your primary Public Investing brokerage account. Cash held in that primary brokerage account does not earn interest.<br />
Cash held at the Partner Banks is eligible for FDIC insurance of up to $5M in the aggregate or $250,000 per Partner Bank, inclusive of any other deposits you may hold at each bank in the same ownership capacity. Public Investing is not responsible for monitoring whether your total aggregate deposits at a Partner Bank exceed FDIC coverage limits.<br />
Funds held in your High-Yield Cash Account, which is a brokerage account with Public Investing, are protected by SIPC. Once funds are swept to a Partner Bank, they are no longer held in your brokerage account and are not protected by SIPC, but instead eligible for FDIC insurance via our Partner Banks.<br />
The minimum initial deposit is $20, but there is no minimum balance that must be maintained. There are no account fees for the High-Yield Cash Account. See our <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/fee-schedule">Fee Schedule</a> for details on other fees that apply when using Public.</p>
<p>Open to the Public Investing, Inc. does not provide legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should consult your legal, tax, or financial advisors before making any financial decisions.<br />

<b>All investments</b> involve the risk of loss and the past performance of a security or a financial product does not guarantee future results or returns. You should consult your legal, tax, or financial advisors before making any financial decisions. This material is not intended as a recommendation, offer, or solicitation to purchase or sell securities, open a brokerage account, or engage in any investment strategy.</p>
<p><b>Securities, Options, Bonds.</b><br />
Self-directed brokerage accounts and brokerage services for US-listed, registered securities, options, and bonds, except for treasury securities offered through Jiko Securities, Inc., are offered to self-directed customers by Open to the Public Investing, Inc. (“Public Investing”), a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>.

Public Investing is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Public Holdings, Inc. (“Public Holdings”). This is not an offer, solicitation of an offer, or advice to buy or sell securities or open a brokerage account in any jurisdiction where Public Investing is not registered. Securities products offered by Public Investing are not FDIC insured. Apex Clearing Corporation, our clearing firm, has additional insurance coverage in excess of the regular <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a> limits. Additional information can be found <a href="https://help.public.com/en/articles/6594797-frequently-asked-questions-sipc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>
<b>Options.</b><br />
Options trading entails significant risk and is not suitable for all investors. Options investors can rapidly lose the value of their investment in a short period of time and incur permanent loss by expiration date. Certain complex options strategies carry additional risk and costs. Investors must read and understand the <a href="https://www.theocc.com/company-information/documents-and-archives/options-disclosure-document">Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options</a> before considering any options transaction. Index options have special features and fees that should be carefully considered, including settlement, exercise, expiration, tax, and cost characteristics. See <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/fee-schedule">Fee Schedule</a> for all options trading fees.  Supporting documentation for any claims will be furnished upon request. To learn more about options rebates, see terms of the <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/rebate-terms">Options Rebate Program</a>. Rebate rates vary monthly from $0.06-$0.18 and depend on your current and prior month’s options trading volume. Rates are subject to change at any time.</p>
<p>
<b>Bonds.</b><br />
“Bonds” shall refer to corporate debt securities and U.S. government securities offered on the Public platform through a self-directed brokerage account held at Public Investing and custodied at Apex Clearing.  For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude  treasury securities held in  treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “Treasury Accounts” section.</p>
<p>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors.  The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa.  Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk.  All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change.  Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond's credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned.  Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.</p>
<p><em>A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond. Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/fee-schedule">Fee Schedule</a></em>.</p>
<p>
<em>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account.  The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</em></p>
<p><em>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages. Read more about the risks associated with <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/fixed-income-disclosure">fixed income</a> and <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/apex-fractional-bond-disclosure">fractional bonds</a>. See <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/bond-account">Bond Account Disclosures</a> to learn more.</em></p>
<p><b id="disclosures-etf-etp">ETFs & ETPs.</b><br />
Before investing in an ETF, you should read the prospectus carefully, which provides detailed information on the fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses and unique risk profile. Prospectuses can be found on the ETF issuer's website.  All investments involve risks, including the loss of principal. Performance data represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate such that an investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost.</p>
<p>A spot bitcoin exchange-traded product (“ETP”) is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) and is not subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (the “CEA”). As a result, shareholders do not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the 1940 Act or the protections afforded by the CEA.  The performance of a spot bitcoin ETP will not reflect the specific return an investor would realize if the investor actually purchased bitcoin. Investors will not have any rights that bitcoin holders have and will not have the right to receive any redemption proceeds in bitcoin.  Digital assets like Bitcoin are highly speculative and may be subject to increased risk of price volatility, illiquidity, market manipulation, and loss, including loss of your entire investment.</p>
<p>
<b>Margin Accounts.</b><br />
Margin investing increases your level of risk and has the potential to magnify your losses, including loss of more than your initial investment.   Please assess your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial circumstances to determine whether margin is appropriate for you.  You must repay your margin debt regardless of the underlying value of the securities you purchased.  Public Investing can change its maintenance margin requirements at any time without prior notice.

<b id="disclosures-hyca">High-Yield Cash Account.</b><br />
A High-Yield Cash Account is a secondary brokerage account with Public Investing. Funds in your High-Yield Cash Account are automatically deposited into partner banks (“Partner Banks”), where that cash earns interest and is eligible for FDIC insurance. See <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/high-yield-account/partners-list">here</a> for a list of current Partner Banks. Your Annual Percentage Yield is variable and may change at the discretion of the Partner Banks or Public Investing. Apex Clearing and Public Investing receive administrative fees for operating this program, which reduce the amount of interest paid on swept cash.  Neither Public Investing nor any of its affiliates is a bank. <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/high-yield-account">Learn more</a>.</p>

<b>Cryptocurrency.</b><br />
Cryptocurrency trading, execution, and custody services are provided by Bakkt Crypto Solutions, LLC (NMLS ID 1828849) (“Bakkt”).

<b id="disclosures-treasuries">Treasury Accounts.</b><br />
Investing services in treasury accounts offering 6 month US Treasury Bills on the Public platform are through Jiko Securities, Inc. (“JSI”), a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>. See JSI’s <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/287507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA BrokerCheck</a> and <a href="https://jiko.io/docs/JikoSecuritiesFormCRS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Form CRS</a> for further information.<br />
JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity).  T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.”  Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash.  The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity.  T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance.  Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk.  As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates.  Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment. <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/jiko-treasuries-risk-disclosure" target="_blank">Jiko U.S. Treasuries Risk Disclosures</a> for further details.</p>
