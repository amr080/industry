<h4>Information from Cookies and Similar Technologies</h4>
<p>        We use cookies, web beacons, mobile analytics and advertising IDs, and similar technologies to operate our Services and to help collect data, including usage data, identifiers, and device information for the purposes described below.</p>
<h4 class="italic">What are cookies and similar technologies?</h4>
<p>        Cookies are small text files placed by a website and stored by your browser on your device. A cookie can later be read when your browser connects to a web server in the same domain that placed the cookie. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers and letters that may uniquely identify your device and can contain other information as well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser over time, each time it connects to that web server.</p>
</p>
<p>        Web beacons are electronic images (also called single-pixel or clear GIFs) that are contained within a website or email. When your browser opens a webpage or email that contains a web beacon, it automatically connects to the web server that hosts the image (typically operated by a third-party). This allows that web server to log information about your device and to set and read its own cookies. In the same way, third-party content on our websites (such as embedded videos, plug-ins, or ads) results in your browser connecting to the third-party web server that hosts that content. We also include web beacons in our email messages or newsletters to tell us if you open and act on them.</p>
</p>
<p>        Mobile analytics and advertising IDs are generated by operating systems for mobile devices (iOS and Android) and can be accessed and used by apps in much the same way that websites access and use cookies. Our apps contain software that enables us and our analytics and advertising providers to access these mobile IDs.</p>
<h4 class="italic">How do we and our providers use cookies and similar technologies?</h4>
<p>        We, and our analytics and advertising providers, use these technologies to collect personal information (such as the pages you visit, the links you click on, and similar usage information, identifiers, and device information) when you use our Services, including personal information about your online activities over time and across different websites or online services.  This personal information is used to store your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, analyze how our websites and apps perform, track your interaction with the site or app, develop inferences, detect, prevent, and combat illegal, fraudulent, and deceptive activity, and fulfill other legitimate purposes. We and/or our providers also share the information we collect or infer with third parties for these purposes. For more information about the third-party analytics and advertising providers that collect personal information on our Services, please see the “<a href="#section-3">Personal Information We Disclose</a>” section of this Privacy Policy.</p>
</p>
<h4 class="italic">What controls are available?</h4>
<p>        There are a range of cookie and related controls available through browsers, mobile operating systems, and elsewhere. See the “<a href="#section-6">Your Personal Information Choices</a>” section below for details.
    </li>

<h4>How We Protect Personal Information</h4>
<p>        We take reasonable and appropriate steps to help protect personal information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p>

<h4>Your Data Protection and Privacy Rights</h4>
<ol class="alpha">
<li id="section-7-1">
<h4 class="italic">California privacy rights</h4>
<p>                If you are a California resident and the processing of personal information about you is subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), then you have certain rights with respect to that information.</p>
</p>
<p>                In general, the CCPA broadly protects personal information that businesses collect from California consumers. However, as described in the “<a href="#section-7-4">U.S. exemptions</a>” section below, the personal information you provide to us may be governed by the Gramm Leach Bliley Act (“GLBA”) or the California Financial Information Privacy Act and not the CCPA.</p>
<ul>
<li>
                        <b>Notice at Collection.</b> At or before the time of collection, you have a right to receive notice of our practices, including the <a href="#section-2">categories</a> of personal information and sensitive personal information to be collected, the <a href="#section-2">purposes</a> for which such information is collected or used, whether such information is <a href="#section-3">sold or shared</a>, and how long such information is <a href="#section-8">retained</a>. You can find those details in this Privacy Policy by clicking on the above links.
                    </li>
<li>
                        <b>Right to Know.</b> You have a right to request that we disclose to you the personal information we have collected about you.  You also have a right to request additional information about our collection, use, disclosure, or sale of such personal information.  Note that we have provided much of this information in this Privacy Policy. You may make such a “request to know” by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@public.com?subject=Right to Know">privacy@public.com</a>.
                    </li>
<li>
                        <b>Rights to Request Correction or Deletion.</b> You also have rights to request that we correct inaccurate personal information and that we delete personal information under certain circumstances, subject to a number of exceptions. To make a request to correct or delete, please email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@public.com?subject=Rights to Request Correction or Deletion">privacy@public.com</a>.
                    </li>
<li>
                        <b>Right to Opt-Out / “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information”.</b> You have a right to opt-out from future “sales” or “sharing” of personal information as those terms are defined by the CCPA. </p>
<p>                        Note that the CCPA defines “sell,” “share” and “personal information” very broadly, and some of our data sharing described in this Privacy Policy may be considered a “sale” or “sharing” under those definitions.</p>
<p>                        In the past 12 months, we have “sold” or “shared” the following categories of personal information: Internet or other electronic network activity. For information about the purposes for which this personal information is used and the categories of recipients with whom this data is shared, see the “Analytics and Advertising Providers” section of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>                        To opt-out from “sharing” of personal information, please review the options within the “<a href="#section-6">Your Personal Information Choices</a>” section of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>                        Other than the “sale” or “sharing” of personal information described above, we do not “sell” or “share” personal information as defined by the CCPA and have not done so in the past 12 months. Additionally, we do not knowingly sell or share the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.
                    </li>
<li>
                        <b>Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information.</b> You have a right to limit our use of sensitive personal information for any purposes other than to provide the services you request or as otherwise permitted by law.</p>
<p>                        Note that we do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for any such additional purposes.
                    </li>
<li>
                        <b>Non-discrimination.</b> Finally, you have a right to not be discriminated against for exercising these rights set out in the CCPA.
                    </li>
</ul>
<p>                Additionally, under California Civil Code section 1798.83, also known as the “Shine the Light” law, California residents who have provided personal information to a business with which the individual has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes (“California Customers”) may request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  </p>
<p>                Please be aware that we do not disclose personal information to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes as defined by this law.</p>
<p>                To exercise your rights, please follow the directions in the “<a href="#section-7-3">Exercising your rights over your data</a>” section below. California Customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@public.com?subject=California privacy rights">privacy@public.com</a>. Please note that businesses are required to respond to one request per California Customer each year and may not be required to respond to requests made by means other than through the designated email address.
            </li>
<li id="section-7-2">
<h4 class="italic">Privacy rights under other U.S. state laws (excluding California)</h4>
<p>If you are a U.S. resident, you may have certain rights with respect to your personal information under applicable state privacy laws (e.g. Colorado, Connecticut, Utah and Virginia). Such rights may include (in each case subject to applicable law):</p>
<ul>
<li>
                    Right to confirm we are processing personal information about you and request access to such personal information</li>
<li>
                        Right to correct inaccurate information
                    </li>
<li>
                        Right to delete personal information provided by or obtained about you
                    </li>
<li>
                        Right to obtain a copy of personal information provided by you in a portable (and to the extent technically feasible) format
                    </li>
<li>
                        To opt out of the processing of the personal information for purposes of (i) targeted advertising, (ii) the sale of personal information, or (iii) profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning the consumer, in each case as further detailed by the underlying U.S. state law
                    </li>
<li>
                        Right to appeal a decision we make with respect to your privacy rights by submitting your request to <a href="mailto:privacy@public.com?subject=Privacy rights under other U.S. state laws">privacy@public.com</a>
                    </li>
</ul>
<p>                To exercise your rights, please follow the directions in the “<a href="#section-7-3">Exercising your rights over your data</a>” section below.</p>
<p>                As further outlined in the “<a href="#section-7-4">U.S. exemptions</a>” section below, please note that in certain cases personal information may be covered by the GLBA and not your applicable state privacy laws.
            </li>
<li id="section-7-3">
<h4 class="italic">Exercising your rights over your data</h4>
<p>In order to process your request, we will need to verify or authenticate your identity to the degree of certainty required by law. We will verify your request by asking you to send it from the email address associated with your account or requiring you to provide other information necessary to verify your account.</p>
<p>Except for the automated controls described in the “<a href="#section-6">Your Personal Information Choices</a>” section above, if you send us a request to exercise your rights, then to the extent permitted by applicable law, we may charge a fee or decline requests in certain cases.</p>
<p>For example, we may decline requests where granting the request would be prohibited by law, could adversely affect the privacy or other rights of another person, would reveal a trade secret or other confidential information, or would interfere with a legal, regulatory or business obligation that requires retention or use of the data.</p>
<p>We may decline a request where we are unable to authenticate you as the person to whom the data relates, the request is unreasonable or excessive, or where otherwise permitted by applicable law.</p>
<p>Where permitted by applicable law, you may also designate, in writing or through a power of attorney, an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf to exercise your rights. Before accepting such a request from an agent, we will require the agent to provide proof you have authorized it to act on your behalf, and we may need you to verify your identity directly with us.</p>
<p>Where permitted by applicable law, if you receive a response from us informing you that we have declined your request, in whole or in part, you may appeal that decision by submitting your appeal using the contact method described at the bottom of this Privacy Policy.</p>
</li>
<li id="section-7-4">
<h4 class="italic">U.S. exemptions</h4>
<p>U.S. state privacy laws generally do not apply to personal information that is subject to the  Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (“GLBA”), a federal law that governs nonpublic personal information collected from customers by financial institutions. If you have applied for or opened a brokerage account with Public, then the personal information you provide to us may be covered by the GLBA and not your applicable state privacy laws. In that case, your information is governed by this Privacy Policy and the GLBA, and the rights provided under the U.S. privacy rights sections do not apply.</p>
<p>Similarly, the CCPA does not apply to personal information that is subject to the California Financial Information Privacy Act.</p>
<p>For a summary of how we use personal information covered by the GLBA, please review this <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/public-us-consumer-privacy-notice">U.S. Consumer Privacy Notice</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li id="section-8">
<h4>How We Retain Personal Information</h4>
<p>        We retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide our Services and fulfill the transactions you have requested, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and for other legitimate and lawful business purposes. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different services, actual retention periods can differ significantly based on criteria such as customer expectations or consent, the sensitivity of the data, the availability of automated controls that enable customers to delete data, and our legal, regulatory or contractual obligations.
    </li>
<li id="section-9">
<h4>Links to Third-Party Websites and Services</h4>
<p>        Our Services may contain links to other websites, products or services that we do not own or operate. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these non-affiliated third parties. Please be aware that this Privacy Policy does not apply to your activities on these third-party services or any information you disclose to these third parties. We encourage you to read their privacy policies before providing any information to them.
    </li>
<li id="section-10">
<h4>Children’s Privacy</h4>
<p>        We do not knowingly collect, maintain, or use personal information from children under 18 years of age, and no part of our Services are directed to children. If you learn that a child has provided us with personal information in violation of this Privacy Policy, then you may alert us at <a href="mailto:privacy@public.com?subject=Children’s Privacy">privacy@public.com</a> with Subject Line: Children’s Privacy.
    </li>
<li id="section-11">
<h4>Alpha</h4>
<p>		Public Holdings offers a standalone mobile application called Alpha by Public (“Alpha”). You do not need a Public brokerage account to use Alpha. Alpha is an artificial intelligence investment exploration tool powered by GPT-4. When you sign up for an account with Alpha, you will provide Public Holdings with your email address. You can unsubscribe from the Alpha app at any time via your iCloud settings on your Apple mobile. Choose “Settings,” tap your name, tap “Subscriptions,” tap the Alpha subscription, and tap “Cancel Subscription.” </p>
<p>		If you are located outside the U.S. and use Alpha, then you may have certain rights with respect to personal information we process about you, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
               <strong>Right of Access.</strong> You have the right to request and receive a copy of your personal data, and other supplementary information.
            </li>
<li>
				<strong>Right to Rectification.</strong> You have the right to request that we correct inaccurate or incorrect data we process about you.
            </li>
<li>
				<strong>Right to Erasure (right to be forgotten).</strong> In certain circumstances, you may have the right to request that we erase your personal data.
			</li>
<li>
				<strong>Restriction of Processing.</strong> In certain circumstances, you may have the right to request that we restrict use of your personal data.
			</li>
<li>
				<strong>Objection to Processing.</strong> You have the right to object to us processing your personal data, where the legal basis for processing that information is legitimate interest.  You have an absolute right to object to us using your personal information for marketing purposes. Our use of your personal data is set out in our “How we use your personal information” section above.
			</li>
<li>
				<strong>Right to Data Portability.</strong> In certain circumstances, you may have the right to data portability. Data portability allows you to request a machine-readable copy of your personal data where our legal basis for processing is either performance of a contract or consent.
			</li>
<li>
				<strong>Withdrawal of Consent.</strong> When we rely on consent to use your personal data, you have the right to withdraw consent at any time.
			</li>
<li>
				<strong>Automated decision-making (including profiling).</strong> If we make a solely automated decision (including profiling) about you that produces a legal or other significant effect on you, then you have the right to object to such decision.
			</li>
<li>
				<strong>Complaints.</strong> You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, but we encourage you to first contact us at privacy@public.com with any questions or concerns.
			</li>
</ul>
<p>		To exercise your rights, please follow the directions in the “<a href="#section-7-3">Exercising your rights over your data</a>” section below. If you have an Alpha account, but do not have a Public brokerage account, then many of the provisions of this Privacy Policy do not apply to you. You can direct any questions about Alpha to <a href="mailto:support@public.com?subject=Alpha Account">support@public.com</a>.

<b>All investments</b> involve the risk of loss and the past performance of a security or a financial product does not guarantee future results or returns. You should consult your legal, tax, or financial advisors before making any financial decisions. This material is not intended as a recommendation, offer, or solicitation to purchase or sell securities, open a brokerage account, or engage in any investment strategy.</p>
<p><b>Securities, Options, Bonds.</b><br />
Self-directed brokerage accounts and brokerage services for US-listed, registered securities, options, and bonds, except for treasury securities offered through Jiko Securities, Inc., are offered to self-directed customers by Open to the Public Investing, Inc. (“Public Investing”), a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>. Additional information about your broker can be found by clicking <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>. Public Investing is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Public Holdings, Inc. (“Public Holdings”). This is not an offer, solicitation of an offer, or advice to buy or sell securities or open a brokerage account in any jurisdiction where Public Investing is not registered. Securities products offered by Public Investing are not FDIC insured. Apex Clearing Corporation, our clearing firm, has additional insurance coverage in excess of the regular <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a> limits. Additional information can be found <a href="https://help.public.com/en/articles/6594797-frequently-asked-questions-sipc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>
<b>Options.</b><br />
Options trading entails significant risk and is not suitable for all investors. Options investors can rapidly lose the value of their investment in a short period of time and incur permanent loss by expiration date. Certain complex options strategies carry additional risk and costs. Investors must read and understand the <a href="https://www.theocc.com/company-information/documents-and-archives/options-disclosure-document">Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options</a> before considering any options transaction. Index options have special features and fees that should be carefully considered, including settlement, exercise, expiration, tax, and cost characteristics. See <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/fee-schedule">Fee Schedule</a> for all options trading fees.  Supporting documentation for any claims will be furnished upon request. To learn more about options rebates, see terms of the <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/rebate-terms">Options Rebate Program</a>. Rebate rates vary monthly from $0.06-$0.18 and depend on your current and prior month’s options trading volume. Rates are subject to change at any time.</p>
<p>
<b>Bonds.</b><br />
“Bonds” shall refer to corporate debt securities and U.S. government securities offered on the Public platform through a self-directed brokerage account held at Public Investing and custodied at Apex Clearing.  For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude  treasury securities held in  treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “Treasury Accounts” section.</p>
<p>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors.  The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa.  Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk.  All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change.  Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond's credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned.  Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.</p>
<p><em>A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond. Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/fee-schedule">Fee Schedule</a></em>.</p>
<p>
<em>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account.  The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</em></p>
<p><em>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages. Read more about the risks associated with <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/fixed-income-disclosure">fixed income</a> and <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/apex-fractional-bond-disclosure">fractional bonds</a>. See <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/bond-account">Bond Account Disclosures</a> to learn more.</em></p>
<p><b id="disclosures-etf-etp">ETFs & ETPs.</b><br />
Before investing in an ETF, you should read the prospectus carefully, which provides detailed information on the fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses and unique risk profile. Prospectuses can be found on the ETF issuer's website.  All investments involve risks, including the loss of principal. Performance data represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate such that an investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost.</p>
<p>A spot bitcoin exchange-traded product (“ETP”) is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) and is not subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (the “CEA”). As a result, shareholders do not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the 1940 Act or the protections afforded by the CEA.  The performance of a spot bitcoin ETP will not reflect the specific return an investor would realize if the investor actually purchased bitcoin. Investors will not have any rights that bitcoin holders have and will not have the right to receive any redemption proceeds in bitcoin.  Digital assets like Bitcoin are highly speculative and may be subject to increased risk of price volatility, illiquidity, market manipulation, and loss, including loss of your entire investment.</p>
<p>
<b>Margin Accounts.</b><br />
Margin investing increases your level of risk and has the potential to magnify your losses, including loss of more than your initial investment.   Please assess your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial circumstances to determine whether margin is appropriate for you.  You must repay your margin debt regardless of the underlying value of the securities you purchased.  Public Investing can change its maintenance margin requirements at any time without prior notice.  If the equity in your margin account falls below the minimum maintenance requirements, you may be required to deposit additional cash or securities.  If you are unable to do so, Public Investing may sell some or all of your securities, without prior approval or notice.  You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call.  For more information please see Public Investing’s <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/margin-disclosure-statement">Margin Disclosure Statement</a>, <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/apex-margin-agreement">Margin Agreement</a>, and <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/fee-schedule">Fee Schedule</a>.</p>
<p>
<b id="disclosures-hyca">High-Yield Cash Account.</b><br />
A High-Yield Cash Account is a secondary brokerage account with Public Investing. Funds in your High-Yield Cash Account are automatically deposited into partner banks (“Partner Banks”), where that cash earns interest and is eligible for FDIC insurance. See <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/high-yield-account/partners-list">here</a> for a list of current Partner Banks. Your Annual Percentage Yield is variable and may change at the discretion of the Partner Banks or Public Investing. Apex Clearing and Public Investing receive administrative fees for operating this program, which reduce the amount of interest paid on swept cash.  Neither Public Investing nor any of its affiliates is a bank. <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/high-yield-account">Learn more</a>.</p>
<p>
<b>Cryptocurrency.</b><br />
Cryptocurrency trading, execution, and custody services are provided by Bakkt Crypto Solutions, LLC (NMLS ID 1828849) (“Bakkt”). Cryptocurrency is highly speculative, involves a high degree of risk, and has the potential for loss of the entire amount of an investment. Cryptocurrencies offered by Bakkt are not securities and are not FDIC insured or protected by <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>. Your cryptocurrency assets are held in your Bakkt account. Bakkt is a licensed virtual currency business by the New York State Department of Financial Services and a licensed money transmitter, but is not a registered broker-dealer or a <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> member. Your Bakkt Crypto account is separate from your brokerage account with Public Investing, which holds US-listed stocks and ETFs. Please review the <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/bakkt-crypto-risk-disclosure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Risk Disclosures</a> before trading.</p>
<p>
<b id="disclosures-treasuries">Treasury Accounts.</b><br />
Investing services in treasury accounts offering 6 month US Treasury Bills on the Public platform are through Jiko Securities, Inc. (“JSI”), a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>. See JSI’s <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/287507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA BrokerCheck</a> and <a href="https://jiko.io/docs/JikoSecuritiesFormCRS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Form CRS</a> for further information.<br />
JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity).  T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.”  Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash.  The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity.  T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance.  Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk.  As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates.  Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment. <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/jiko-treasuries-risk-disclosure" target="_blank">Jiko U.S. Treasuries Risk Disclosures</a> for further details.</p>
<p><b style="font-size: 115%;">Investments in T-bills: Not FDIC Insured; No Bank Guarantee; May Lose Value. </b></p>
