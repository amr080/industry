		<summary>
			Why do companies issue corporate bonds?		</summary>
		<p>Companies issue corporate bonds to raise capital for various purposes, such as funding expansion, investing in new projects, or refinancing debt. Unlike selling company shares, issuing bonds allows them to secure funds without diluting ownership or ceding control. Bondholders receive periodic interest payments and the promise of repayment at maturity. Corporate bonds also offer tax advantages for companies compared to other forms of financing. Investors, in turn, seek to receive a steady income stream and a relatively secure investment, as bonds are backed by the company&#8217;s assets and repayment promise.</p>
	</details>
	<details>
		<summary>
			How often do companies issue new corporate bonds?		</summary>
		<p>Companies issue new corporate bonds as needed to raise capital for specific projects, debt refinancing, or other financial requirements. It can range from several times a year to less often, depending on the company&#8217;s financial strategies and market conditions. Factors such as interest rates, economic conditions, and the company&#8217;s financial health influence when and how often they issue bonds.</p>
	</details>
	<details>
		<summary>
			What is the difference between buying a corporate bond vs. buying stock in the same company?		</summary>
		<p>When you buy a corporate bond, you&#8217;re lending money to the company and become a creditor. In return, you receive regular interest payments and the promise of repayment at maturity, making it a relatively low-risk investment, though all investments involve risk. On the other hand, buying company stock means you own a portion of the company, which comes with the potential for capital gains but also greater risk as stock prices can fluctuate significantly. Investors turn to corporate bonds when seeking out predictable income, and stocks for ownership and potential for higher returns, which comes with greater volatility.</p>
	</details>
	<details>
		<summary>
			Why do some investors use bonds within their portfolio strategies?		</summary>
		<p>Investors use bonds in their portfolio strategies for diversification, income, and risk management. Bonds provide a stable source of income through periodic interest payments. They can also act as a counterbalance to the volatility of stocks, enhancing portfolio stability. Diversifying with bonds can reduce overall risk as they often move differently than stocks in response to economic conditions. Additionally, bonds are crucial for preserving capital and meeting financial goals, making them a valuable component of a well-rounded investment portfolio. Retail investors use bonds as a way to balance the potential for higher returns from stocks while maintaining a safety net of steady income and reduced risk.</p>
	</details>
	<details>
		<summary>
			What is the relationship between bond prices and bond yields?		</summary>
		<p>Bond prices and bond yields have an inverse relationship. When bond prices rise, bond yields fall, and vice versa. This inverse relationship is due to the fixed-interest payments bonds provide. If you buy a bond with a fixed coupon rate, and market interest rates drop, your bond becomes more attractive to investors, causing its price to rise. On the other hand, if market rates rise, your fixed-rate bond&#8217;s interest payments become less competitive, resulting in a lower price. This dynamic is crucial for investors, as it impacts the value of their bond holdings and the attractiveness of new bond purchases in changing interest rate environments.</p>
	</details>
	<details>
		<summary>
			What is the yield curve and what does it signal about the bond market overall?		</summary>
		<p>The yield curve is a graphical representation of interest rates for bonds with different maturities. It typically slopes upward, with short-term rates lower than long-term rates. The shape of the yield curve conveys vital information about the bond market and the economy. A normal yield curve, with the long end showing higher yields, suggests a healthy economy. An inverted curve, with short-term rates higher than long-term rates, can indicate economic uncertainty or potential recession. A flat curve may signal an economic transition.</p>

			What are bond ratings and why do they matter?		</summary>
		<p>Bond ratings are assessments of a bond&#8217;s creditworthiness and risk issued by rating agencies like Moody&#8217;s and S&#038;P, and they can help investors gauge the safety and reliability of a bond investment. Ratings range from high (e.g., AAA) for the lowest risk to lower ratings (e.g., BB or below) indicating higher risk. Investors use these ratings to make informed decisions, balancing risk and return. Lower-rated bonds offer higher potential returns but come with increased risk, including the possibility of default. Bond ratings provide a valuable reference point for investors to align their risk tolerance and investment goals with the appropriate bonds in their portfolios.</p>

			What is the difference between bonds with fixed-rate corporate bonds vs. variable-rate corporate bonds?		</summary>
		<p>Fixed-rate bonds offer a set interest rate throughout the bond&#8217;s term, providing predictability but potentially lower returns if market rates rise. In contrast, variable-rate bonds have interest rates that adjust periodically. This adjustment makes them more responsive to changing market rates, offering the potential for higher returns if rates increase. Investors choosing between them should consider their risk tolerance and the prevailing interest rate environment, as fixed-rate bonds provide stability, while variable-rate bonds offer flexibility and the chance for greater income in rising-rate environments.</p>

			What is the difference between Treasury bonds and Treasury bills?		</summary>
		<p>The key difference between Treasury bonds and Treasury bills is their maturity. Treasury bonds have longer maturities, typically ranging from 10 to 30 years, making them ideal for long-term investors seeking a steady income stream and a safe haven for capital. In contrast, Treasury bills, often referred to as T-bills, have short-term maturities, typically less than one year, making them a preferred choice for investors looking for a secure, short-term parking place for their money. Both are considered extremely low-risk as they are backed by the full faith and credit of U.S. government.</p>

			What happens if you sell a bond before its maturity date?		</summary>
		<p>If you sell a bond before its maturity date, you&#8217;ll encounter the bond&#8217;s market price, which may be higher or lower than its face value. The price fluctuates due to changes in interest rates, credit risk, and market demand. Selling a bond before maturity can result in capital gains if you sell it at a price higher than you paid, or capital losses if you sell it for less. It provides flexibility but also exposes you to potential gains or losses, influenced by the prevailing interest rate environment and the bond&#8217;s creditworthiness. Consider these factors when deciding to sell a bond before its maturity.</p>

		<summary>
			How are bond yields taxed?		</summary>
		<p>The tax implications of bond yields vary across different types of bonds:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Corporate Bonds:</strong> Interest income from corporate bonds is subject to federal and often state income taxes, impacting the after-tax yield. Higher-income individuals may face higher tax rates.</li>
<li><strong>Treasury Bonds:</strong> Interest from U.S. Treasury bonds is taxable at the federal level but exempt from state and local taxes. This tax advantage can enhance the after-tax return for investors.</li>
<li><strong>Municipal Bonds:</strong> Interest from municipal bonds is typically exempt from federal taxes and, if the bond is issued in your state, may also be exempt from state and local taxes, offering tax-efficient income, especially for investors in high tax brackets and in-state residents.</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding these tax implications is essential for making informed investment decisions aligned with your tax situation and financial goals.</p>

Treasury bonds have longer maturities, typically ranging from 10 to 30 years, making them ideal for long-term investors seeking a steady income stream and a safe haven for capital. In contrast, Treasury bills, often referred to as T-bills, have short-term maturities, typically less than one year, making them a preferred choice for investors looking for a secure, short-term parking place for their money. Both are considered extremely low-risk as they are backed by the full faith and credit of U.S. government.

The price fluctuates due to changes in interest rates, credit risk, and market demand. Selling a bond before maturity can result in capital gains if you sell it at a price higher than you paid, or capital losses if you sell it for less. It provides flexibility but also exposes you to potential gains or losses, influenced by the prevailing interest rate environment and the bond&amp;#8217;s creditworthiness. Consider these factors when deciding to sell a bond before its maturity.

Corporate Bonds: Interest income from corporate bonds is subject to federal and often state income taxes, impacting the after-tax yield. Higher-income individuals may face higher tax rates.
Treasury Bonds: Interest from U.S. Treasury bonds is taxable at the federal level but exempt from state and local taxes. This tax advantage can enhance the after-tax return for investors.
Municipal Bonds: Interest from municipal bonds is typically exempt from federal taxes and, if the bond is issued in your state, may also be exempt from state and local taxes, offering tax-efficient income, especially for investors in high tax brackets and in-state residents.

Understanding these tax implications is essential for making informed investment decisions aligned with your tax situation and financial goals.

Additional information can be found <a href="https://help.public.com/en/articles/6594797-frequently-asked-questions-sipc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>
<b>Options.</b><br />
Options trading entails significant risk and is not suitable for all investors. Options investors can rapidly lose the value of their investment in a short period of time and incur permanent loss by expiration date. Certain complex options strategies carry additional risk and costs. Investors must read and understand the <a href="https://www.theocc.com/company-information/documents-and-archives/options-disclosure-document">Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options</a> before considering any options transaction. Index options have special features and fees that should be carefully considered, including settlement, exercise, expiration, tax, and cost characteristics. See <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/fee-schedule">Fee Schedule</a> for all options trading fees.  Supporting documentation for any claims will be furnished upon request. To learn more about options rebates, see terms of the <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/rebate-terms">Options Rebate Program</a>. Rebate rates vary monthly from $0.06-$0.18 and depend on your current and prior month’s options trading volume. Rates are subject to change at any time.</p>
<p>
<b>Bonds.</b><br />
“Bonds” shall refer to corporate debt securities and U.S. government securities offered on the Public platform through a self-directed brokerage account held at Public Investing and custodied at Apex Clearing.  For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude  treasury securities held in  treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “Treasury Accounts” section.</p>
<p>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors.  The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa.  Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk.  All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change.  Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond's credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned.  Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.</p>
<p><em>A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond. Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/fee-schedule">Fee Schedule</a></em>.</p>
<p>
<em>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account.  The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</em></p>
<p><em>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages. Read more about the risks associated with <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/fixed-income-disclosure">fixed income</a> and <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/apex-fractional-bond-disclosure">fractional bonds</a>. See <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/bond-account">Bond Account Disclosures</a> to learn more.</em></p>
<p><b id="disclosures-etf-etp">ETFs & ETPs.</b><br />
Before investing in an ETF, you should read the prospectus carefully, which provides detailed information on the fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses and unique risk profile. Prospectuses can be found on the ETF issuer's website.  All investments involve risks, including the loss of principal. Performance data represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate such that an investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost.</p>
<p>A spot bitcoin exchange-traded product (“ETP”) is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) and is not subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (the “CEA”). As a result, shareholders do not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the 1940 Act or the protections afforded by the CEA.  The performance of a spot bitcoin ETP will not reflect the specific return an investor would realize if the investor actually purchased bitcoin. Investors will not have any rights that bitcoin holders have and will not have the right to receive any redemption proceeds in bitcoin.  Digital assets like Bitcoin are highly speculative and may be subject to increased risk of price volatility, illiquidity, market manipulation, and loss, including loss of your entire investment.</p>
<p>
<b>Margin Accounts.</b><br />
Margin investing increases your level of risk and has the potential to magnify your losses, including loss of more than your initial investment.   Please assess your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial circumstances to determine whether margin is appropriate for you.  You must repay your margin debt regardless of the underlying value of the securities you purchased.  Public Investing can change its maintenance margin requirements at any time without prior notice.  If the equity in your margin account falls below the minimum maintenance requirements, you may be required to deposit additional cash or securities.  If you are unable to do so, Public Investing may sell some or all of your securities, without prior approval or notice.  You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call.  For more information please see Public Investing’s <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/margin-disclosure-statement">Margin Disclosure Statement</a>, <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/apex-margin-agreement">Margin Agreement</a>, and <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/fee-schedule">Fee Schedule</a>.</p>
<p>
<b id="disclosures-hyca">High-Yield Cash Account.</b><br />
A High-Yield Cash Account is a secondary brokerage account with Public Investing. Funds in your High-Yield Cash Account are automatically deposited into partner banks (“Partner Banks”), where that cash earns interest and is eligible for FDIC insurance. See <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/high-yield-account/partners-list">here</a> for a list of current Partner Banks. Your Annual Percentage Yield is variable and may change at the discretion of the Partner Banks or Public Investing. Apex Clearing and Public Investing receive administrative fees for operating this program, which reduce the amount of interest paid on swept cash.  Neither Public Investing nor any of its affiliates is a bank. <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/high-yield-account">Learn more</a>.</p>
<p>
<b>Cryptocurrency.</b><br />
Cryptocurrency trading, execution, and custody services are provided by Bakkt Crypto Solutions, LLC (NMLS ID 1828849) (“Bakkt”). Cryptocurrency is highly speculative, involves a high degree of risk, and has the potential for loss of the entire amount of an investment. Cryptocurrencies offered by Bakkt are not securities and are not FDIC insured or protected by <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>. Your cryptocurrency assets are held in your Bakkt account. Bakkt is a licensed virtual currency business by the New York State Department of Financial Services and a licensed money transmitter, but is not a registered broker-dealer or a <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> member. Your Bakkt Crypto account is separate from your brokerage account with Public Investing, which holds US-listed stocks and ETFs. Please review the <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/bakkt-crypto-risk-disclosure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Risk Disclosures</a> before trading.</p>

<b id="disclosures-treasuries">Treasury Accounts.</b><br />
Investing services in treasury accounts offering 6 month US Treasury Bills on the Public platform are through Jiko Securities, Inc. (“JSI”), a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>.

JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity).  T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.”  Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash.  The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity.  T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance.  Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk.  As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates.  Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment. <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/jiko-treasuries-risk-disclosure" target="_blank">Jiko U.S. Treasuries Risk Disclosures</a> for further details.</p>
