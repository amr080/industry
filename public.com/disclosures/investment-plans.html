Public Investing reserves the right to modify and cancel the program at any time. The <a href="/disclosures/public-brokerage-agreement">Open to the Public Investing, Inc. Brokerage Agreement</a> (the “Brokerage Agreement”) is incorporated herein by reference and constitutes a part of these Terms and Conditions. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and Conditions and the terms of the Brokerage Agreement, the terms of the Brokerage Agreement shall control.</p>
<p>Investment Plans (“Plans”) are self-directed purchases of individually-selected assets, which may include stocks, exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), and cryptocurrencies. You reserve the ability to pause or end your Plans at any time and for any reason. Plans are available on Public Holding, Inc.’s (“Public”) website and mobile application (together, the “Public Platform”).</p>
<h3>Eligibility Requirements</h3>
<p>Brokerage services for stocks and ETFs are offered by Public Investing, a registered broker-dealer and member FINRA &amp; SIPC. To create a Plan with stocks and ETFs, you must have an approved brokerage account with Public Investing.</p>
<p>Cryptocurrency execution and custody services are offered on the Public Platform by Bakkt Crypto Solutions, LLC (“Bakkt Crypto”) (NMLS ID 1828849) through a software licensing agreement between Bakkt Crypto and Public Crypto, LLC (“Public Crypto”). Bakkt Crypto is an unaffiliated third party and is not a registered broker-dealer or a member of SIPC or FINRA. Cryptocurrencies are not securities and are not FDIC or SIPC insured. Bakkt Crypto is licensed to engage in virtual currency business activity by the New York State Department of Financial Services. To create a Plan with cryptocurrency, you must have an approved account with Bakkt Crypto.</p>
<p>This technology is only available to U.S. residents residing within the United States. Public Investing and Bakkt Crypto reserve the right to create limits on the number of Plan orders you may place in equities and cryptocurrencies, respectively. Other restrictions may apply as determined from time to time by Public Investing in its sole discretion and without notice.</p>
<h3>Purchasing a Plan</h3>
<p>You can create an Investment Plan by creating your own custom mix of assets or by choosing a Plan from our marketplace and editing it to meet your needs. Investment Plans use fractional shares, which allow you to set an overall dollar amount for your Plan and then allocate a percentage of that amount to each individual holding. After finalizing your assets and allocations, select the amount and frequency you’d like to invest.</p>
<p>On the day your Plan is scheduled to execute, you will receive one confirmation email for the entire Plan. Once the Plan executes, you will see each individual trade within your “History” in the Public app.</p>
<p>There is a possibility that orders for individual assets within the Plan may not be executed, for example, if trading has been halted for a particular asset. In such a situation, the allocations of the remaining assets will not adjust to account for the un-executed order.</p>
<p>Plans may be subject to minimum amount requirements. Public Investing reserves the right to change the minimum amount at any time without notice. If you choose to create a Plan, you must maintain sufficient funds in your bank account to execute the recurring investment. If your ACH payment fails, any scheduled orders in your Plan will be skipped until you have a successful ACH payment. After three failed or skipped occurrences, Public Investing will automatically pause your Plan.</p>
<h3>Fees</h3>
<p>For Plans containing equities, Public Investing charges a fee to place the recurring securities orders. Each time a recurring purchase for your Plan is made, Public Investing charges a fee that is based on the frequency and number of securities in your Plan. For more details, see the fee tiers <a href="/disclosures/fee-schedule">here</a>.</p>
<p>For Plans containing cryptocurrency, Apex Crypto charges a fee to execute the recurring cryptocurrency purchases in your Plan. That fee is 1.25% of the total cryptocurrency order amount. This covers the costs associated with facilitating crypto transactions and storage. Public Crypto, LLC (“Public Crypto”) receives a portion of the revenue generated by Apex Crypto in exchange for licensing our software to Apex Crypto. For more details, see the fee tiers <a href="/disclosures/fee-schedule">here</a>.</p>
<p>ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses.</p>
<p>For Plans containing cryptocurrency, Bakkt Crypto charges a fee to execute the recurring cryptocurrency purchases in your Plan. That fee is 1.25% of the total cryptocurrency order amount. This covers the costs associated with facilitating crypto transactions and storage. Public Crypto receives a portion of the revenue generated by BakktCrypto in exchange for licensing our software to Bakkt Crypto. For more details, see the fee tiers <a href="/disclosures/fee-schedule">here</a>.</p>
<p>Any transaction fees will be automatically deducted from the total funding amount you selected at the time of each transaction.</p>
<h3>Allocation</h3>
<p>Plans allow you to customize your self-directed asset selection in increments of 1%, with a minimum of 1% of the total Plan for any given symbol. Allocations will be applied proportionally to the total funding amount, inclusive of any transaction fees.</p>
<p>Once a Plan is created, you are solely responsible for establishing and maintaining the allocations within your Plan. Public Investing will not rebalance your Plan or update your allocations in any way, except in instances of Corporate Actions, where you will be notified.</p>
<p>Diversification and asset allocation do not guarantee future returns or eliminate the risk of loss. Investment Plans are not intended to ensure adequate diversification and you should conduct your own research and make your own determinations as to whether a particular investment aligns with your investment objectives, risk tolerance and financial situation.</p>
<h3>Not an Investment Recommendation or Solicitation and Other Disclosures</h3>
<p>Investment Plans shown in the marketplace are for informational purposes only. Investment Plans are meant to provide a helpful starting point as you discover, research, and create an Investment Plan that meets your specific investing needs. Investment Plans presented in the marketplace are created using defined, objective criteria based on generally accepted investment theory. They are made up of stocks and ETFs only. Refer to the Investment Plan <a href="/disclosures/investment-plans-methodology">Methodology</a> to learn more. Edit any Investment Plan to suit your unique investment needs by removing symbols and adjusting allocations.</p>
<p>An Investment Plan, and any additional information provided about it, is not a recommendation of a Plan overall, or a recommendation of its individual holdings or default allocations. By building a Plan, you acknowledge that none of Public, Public Investing, Public Crypto, Bakkt Crypto, or any other unaffiliated third parties (a “Sponsor”) are advising you as to your investments, and any criteria for your initial and ongoing investments should not be considered investment advice, an offer to buy or sell, or a recommendation for any asset or group of assets. You can edit all Plans as you see fit. Plans will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated in any way, except for Corporate Actions. You are solely responsible for establishing and maintaining allocations among assets within your Plan. Plans involve continuous investments, regardless of market conditions.</p>
<p>If you choose to purchase a Plan from our marketplace, keep in mind that specific industry and thematic Plans that are narrower in focus may be more volatile than investments that diversify holdings across multiple industries and themes.</p>
<p>When you purchase an Investment Plan for your personal non-business purposes, you accept all responsibility for its use and implementation, and for appropriate ongoing follow-up to ensure that you are meeting your individualized interests and goals. As with other investments through Public Investing, you must decide for yourself if an investment in an asset is consistent with your evaluation of the assets, your investment objectives, your risk tolerance, your investment time frame, and your broader financial situation. By making Investment Plans available to its members, Public Investing is not recommending or endorsing it. Further, Public assumes no responsibility for the accuracy, completeness or timeliness of any point-in-time Investment Plan allocation or for updating such allocation, which is subject to change without notice at any time. Public does not provide investment, tax or legal advice.</p>
<p>Certain Plans may be “sponsored” by a Sponsor. If a Plan is sponsored, Public Investing will receive compensation from the Sponsor, which will be disclosed within the app and in the <a href="/disclosures/sponsored-content-disclosure">Sponsored Content Disclosure</a>. Sponsored Plans are not a recommendation of a Plan overall or a recommendation of its individual holdings or default allocations; you can edit these Plans as you see fit. You should consider your own investment objectives to make the choices best suited for your investment needs. Additional information regarding this conflict of interest can be found in the Public Investing <a href="https://files.brokercheck.finra.org/crs_127818.pdf">Form CRS</a>.</p>
<p>Your Plan may include ETFs. Before investing in an ETF, you should read the prospectus, which provides detailed information on the ETF’s investment objective, principal investment strategies, risks, costs, and historical performance (if any), among other things. Prospectuses can be found on the ETF issuer’s website. ETFs are bought and sold at market price, which can vary from the Net Asset Value of the fund. Rebalancing and other fund activities may result in tax consequences.</p>
<p>Securities and cryptocurrencies may be shown in a consolidated manner on the Public Platform to create a comprehensive view of your holdings; this is strictly done for convenience purposes only. Notwithstanding the consolidated presentation, all communications on the Public Platform with respect to securities are by Public Investing and all communications with respect to cryptocurrencies are by Bakkt Crypto.</p>
<p>Any graphics shown on the Public Platform in connection with Investment Plans are for illustrative purposes only.</p>
<h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
<p>All access to and use of the Public Platform, as well as your use of the Plans and related services is at your own risk. In no event shall Public, Public Investing, Public Crypto, Bakkt Crypto, any Sponsor, or each of their affiliates, and any of their respective officers, directors, employees and agents be liable for any damages, including, without limitation, direct or indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages, or losses or expenses arising or in connection with use of the Plans. These parties shall not be responsible if you are unable to use the Public Platform or any linked site, or in the event of any failure of performance, error, omission, interruption, defect, delay in operation or transmission, computer virus online or system failure, even if these parties are advised of the possibility of such damages, losses or expenses. Additionally, these parties shall have no liability to you for any losses, financial or otherwise, suffered by you arising out of or resulting from compatibility or inoperability problems of the Public Platform, your computer or other device, or your failure to confirm any attempted transaction.</p>
<h3>Plan Duration and Termination</h3>
<p>Plans remain in effect until you end your Plan or we otherwise terminate your Plan. Public Investing reserves the right to suspend or terminate your Plan at any time, for any reason, without notice to you. Any services associated with the Plans may also be terminated by us at any time. If you breach any of these Terms and Conditions, the rights granted herein shall automatically terminate.</p>
<h3>Changes to Terms and Conditions</h3>
<p>Public Investing may change the Terms and Conditions by posting an updated version of the Terms and Conditions on the Public Platform without notice to you. Please review the current version of the Terms and Conditions from time to time. Your continued use of the Plans feature shall be deemed your acceptance of the Terms and Conditions in place at that time.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<ul>
<li>Waiver: If Public Investing does not enforce a particular provision of the Terms and Conditions, such conduct will not prevent us from enforcing the same or any other provision of the Terms and Conditions in the future.</li>
<li>Severability: If any provision of these Terms and Conditions is or becomes illegal, invalid or unenforceable, it shall be considered separate and severable from these Terms and Conditions, and the remaining provisions shall remain in effect.</li>

<b>Options.</b><br />
Options trading entails significant risk and is not suitable for all investors. Options investors can rapidly lose the value of their investment in a short period of time and incur permanent loss by expiration date. Certain complex options strategies carry additional risk and costs. Investors must read and understand the <a href="https://www.theocc.com/company-information/documents-and-archives/options-disclosure-document">Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options</a> before considering any options transaction. Index options have special features and fees that should be carefully considered, including settlement, exercise, expiration, tax, and cost characteristics. See <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/fee-schedule">Fee Schedule</a> for all options trading fees.  Supporting documentation for any claims will be furnished upon request. To learn more about options rebates, see terms of the <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/rebate-terms">Options Rebate Program</a>. Rebate rates vary monthly from $0.06-$0.18 and depend on your current and prior month’s options trading volume. Rates are subject to change at any time.</p>

“Bonds” shall refer to corporate debt securities and U.S. government securities offered on the Public platform through a self-directed brokerage account held at Public Investing and custodied at Apex Clearing.  For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude  treasury securities held in  treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “Treasury Accounts” section.</p>
<p>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors.  The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa.  Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk.  All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change.  Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond's credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned.  Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.</p>
<p><em>A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond. Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/fee-schedule">Fee Schedule</a></em>.</p>
<p>
<em>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account.  The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</em></p>
<p><em>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages. Read more about the risks associated with <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/fixed-income-disclosure">fixed income</a> and <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/apex-fractional-bond-disclosure">fractional bonds</a>. See <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/bond-account">Bond Account Disclosures</a> to learn more.</em></p>
<p><b id="disclosures-etf-etp">ETFs & ETPs.</b><br />
Before investing in an ETF, you should read the prospectus carefully, which provides detailed information on the fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses and unique risk profile. Prospectuses can be found on the ETF issuer's website.  All investments involve risks, including the loss of principal. Performance data represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate such that an investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost.</p>
<p>A spot bitcoin exchange-traded product (“ETP”) is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) and is not subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (the “CEA”). As a result, shareholders do not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the 1940 Act or the protections afforded by the CEA.  The performance of a spot bitcoin ETP will not reflect the specific return an investor would realize if the investor actually purchased bitcoin. Investors will not have any rights that bitcoin holders have and will not have the right to receive any redemption proceeds in bitcoin.  Digital assets like Bitcoin are highly speculative and may be subject to increased risk of price volatility, illiquidity, market manipulation, and loss, including loss of your entire investment.</p>
<p>
<b>Margin Accounts.</b><br />
Margin investing increases your level of risk and has the potential to magnify your losses, including loss of more than your initial investment.   Please assess your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial circumstances to determine whether margin is appropriate for you.  You must repay your margin debt regardless of the underlying value of the securities you purchased.  Public Investing can change its maintenance margin requirements at any time without prior notice.  If the equity in your margin account falls below the minimum maintenance requirements, you may be required to deposit additional cash or securities.  If you are unable to do so, Public Investing may sell some or all of your securities, without prior approval or notice.  You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call.  For more information please see Public Investing’s <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/margin-disclosure-statement">Margin Disclosure Statement</a>, <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/apex-margin-agreement">Margin Agreement</a>, and <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/fee-schedule">Fee Schedule</a>.</p>
<p>
<b id="disclosures-hyca">High-Yield Cash Account.</b><br />
A High-Yield Cash Account is a secondary brokerage account with Public Investing. Funds in your High-Yield Cash Account are automatically deposited into partner banks (“Partner Banks”), where that cash earns interest and is eligible for FDIC insurance. See <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/high-yield-account/partners-list">here</a> for a list of current Partner Banks. Your Annual Percentage Yield is variable and may change at the discretion of the Partner Banks or Public Investing. Apex Clearing and Public Investing receive administrative fees for operating this program, which reduce the amount of interest paid on swept cash.  Neither Public Investing nor any of its affiliates is a bank. <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/high-yield-account">Learn more</a>.</p>
<p>
<b>Cryptocurrency.</b><br />
Cryptocurrency trading, execution, and custody services are provided by Bakkt Crypto Solutions, LLC (NMLS ID 1828849) (“Bakkt”). Cryptocurrency is highly speculative, involves a high degree of risk, and has the potential for loss of the entire amount of an investment. Cryptocurrencies offered by Bakkt are not securities and are not FDIC insured or protected by <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>. Your cryptocurrency assets are held in your Bakkt account. Bakkt is a licensed virtual currency business by the New York State Department of Financial Services and a licensed money transmitter, but is not a registered broker-dealer or a <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> member. Your Bakkt Crypto account is separate from your brokerage account with Public Investing, which holds US-listed stocks and ETFs.

<b id="disclosures-treasuries">Treasury Accounts.</b><br />
Investing services in treasury accounts offering 6 month US Treasury Bills on the Public platform are through Jiko Securities, Inc. (“JSI”), a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>.

JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity).  T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.”  Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash.  The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity.  T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance.  Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk.  As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates.  Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment. <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/jiko-treasuries-risk-disclosure" target="_blank">Jiko U.S. Treasuries Risk Disclosures</a> for further details.</p>
