    <h2>401k</h2>
    <p><p>If your employer offers a 401(k) program, then this is something you might want to pursue as a first step in your investing journey. These programs work by investing your money before taxes are applied. Some employers offer a match perk, whereby they agree to put in money to match your savings up to a certain amount.</p><p>Another benefit of employer-sponsored 401(k)s is that they offer built-in accountability. You need not remember to invest because the money is automatically removed from your paychecks. If its not in your bank account, you can&rsquo;t spend it elsewhere.</p>

    <h2>50/30/20 rules</h2>
    <p><p>The 50/30/20 Rule is simple to employ, and you start by calculating your after-tax income. If you work a traditional job and have your taxes removed from each paycheck, this one is simple. Add up whats deposited into your bank each month. If you are freelancing, take 30% off the top of what you earn each month to account for your self-pay taxes. If your income is of an unpredictable nature, review the last six months of your earnings and average them out. 50% goes towards necessities, 30% towards wants, and 20% towards savings.</p>

    <h2>ADR</h2>
    <p><p>The stocks of most foreign companies that trade in the U.S. markets are traded as American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). U.S. depositary banks issue these stocks. Each ADR represents one or more shares of foreign stock or a fraction of a share. If you own an ADR, you have the right to obtain the foreign stock it represents, but U.S. investors usually find it more convenient to own the ADR. The price of an ADR corresponds to the price of the foreign stock in its home market, adjusted to the ratio of the ADRs to foreign company shares.</p>

    <h2>Annuities</h2>
    <p><p>An annuity is a product sold by insurance companies. You pay for the annuity through a lump sum or by making payments over time, then the insurance company invests your money, paying you the residuals at the end of the term. One giant pro is that an annuity has the ability to pay out regular payments each month. These payments could provide a supplemental income during your retirement, even enough to cover your regular expenses. These are complex arrangements orchestrated by an insurance company and as such, come with high fees. Most will have administrative fees, mortality, and expense fees that cover the costs and risks of insuring your money.</p>

    <h2>APR</h2>
    <p><p>The term annual percentage rate of charge, corresponding sometimes to a nominal APR and sometimes to an effective APR, is the interest rate for a whole year, rather than just a monthly fee/rate, as applied on a loan, mortgage loan, credit card, etc. It is a finance charge expressed as an annual rate</p>

<article class="options-glossary__entry">
    <h2>APY</h2>
    <p><p>A savings account Annual Percentage Yield (APY) will show you how much interest you can expect to earn over the course of a year. For example, if you deposited $10,000 into a savings account with an APY of 2%, you can expect to earn roughly $200 in interest in one years time. If you were to withdraw all of your money after the first six months, you&rsquo;d get $100 in interest. You can use APY to compare different savings accounts advertised interest rates.</p>

    <h2>Back End Load</h2>
    <p><p>Applies to Mutual Funds. A back-end load is basically paying the front-end load when you make your withdrawal as opposed to when you make your deposit. You&rsquo;re highly unlikely to pay both. The front-end and back-end load actually end up being the same amount since, for example, 2.5% upfront is the same as 2.5% at the end, once the profits are removed.</p>

    <h2>Bond Benefits</h2>
    <p><p>Bonds are typically low-risk investments that come with the added benefit, in the case of government or municipal bonds, of helping public goods and services come to fruition. In the case of junk bonds, you can also get a greater return on investment as compensation for taking on a greater risk, which means you could be helping an important yet uncertain venture achieve realization, if thats of concern for you. Tangentially, keeping track of bonds is also important because an inverted yield rate, which is what happens when short term government bonds deliver a better return than long term government bonds, is often a precursor to a recession.</p>

    <p><p>Common stock is the most common stock bought. Each share bought is equal to a single vote at a shareholder meeting. Common stocks often, but not always, entitle their owner to a portion of the companys profits, which is known as a dividend. Sometimes a dividend can be paid in the form of more stock rather cash. In the case of large companies, dividends are usually paid out four times a year. </p><p>Not all companies pay dividends, and companies opt to withhold dividends for varying reasons. Sometimes these businesses choose to reinvest in the company and its growth with an ambition to create capital gains for shareholders. In general, growth companies are more likely to reinvest in the business, while more mature companies are more likely to pay out dividends to their shareholders.</p>

    <h2>Credit Card Debt</h2>
    <p><p>High-interest credit card debt can hamper your ability to maneuver financially, especially since your credit score will impact your ability to take out loans in the future. For this reason, a good rule of thumb is to maintain little to no credit card debt.</p><p>If need be, you can use a balance transfer card, allows you to pay off one debt with another card. The advantage of this approach is that you can consolidate debts for a fee that is a small percentage of your debt. If you have a mortgage, you can attempt a cash-out mortgage refinance, which is when you refinance your mortgage (meaning you get a loan with different constraints) for a sum thats greater than your original mortgage. With these additional funds, you can pay off your credit card debt.</p><p>In both cases, keep in mind that getting out of debt is a two-step process. The first step entails stopping the bleeding by tackling the debt you have head-on. The second step, of critical importance, is to identify the habits that got you into debt in the first place and correct them for the future.</p>

    <h2>Dollar Cost Averaging</h2>
    <p><p>Dollar-cost averaging is an investment strategy that involves investing a fixed amount of money in the same funds or stocks at regular intervals over long periods of time. It might seem like a crazy idea, but if you have an employer-sponsored 401(k) retirement plan, you&rsquo;re already using this strategy.</p><p>When you set up recurring investments, you average out your purchase price over time and help prevent all of your purchases from going through at a high point for stock prices. Its impossible to time the marketthe experts say don&rsquo;t even bother trying. Instead, purchase throughout the year and the price you&rsquo;ve paid per share will be averaged out over the highs and lows of that whole 12-month period.</p><p>For example, if a stock is trading at $100 per share in January, and then continues to rise by 10% each month, it will trade at almost $285 in December. When was the right time to jump in and buy that stock and how would you know? Using dollar-cost averaging, you could have invested $150 each month into purchasing stocks, or fractions thereof, and averaged out your price all of the monthly prices added up and then divided by 12. In this case, $162.</p><p>Now consider that versus if you had just plunked down $1,200 to make a bulk stock purchase in December. That would mean paying $285 per share and therefore buying fewer of them.</p>

Only when you sell the stock you can lock in those gains, and the result is you making money on that stock!</p>

    <h2>GFV</h2>
    <p><p>If you buy a stock with settled funds today, you can technically sell the stock tomorrow without getting a violation. Now for the tricky part. You can then use those funds from the sale to purchase more stock immediately, however if you sell that stock before the 2 day settlements period, those would be considered unsettled funds and that would result in a cash account violation. As a reminder, trades placed in a cash account require 2 business days to settle before you can use those funds to buy and sell. I hope this clears things up, and we&rsquo;re here if you need anything else!</p>

    <p><p>If your account falls below the firm&rsquo;s maintenance requirement, your firm generally will make a margin call to ask you to deposit more cash or securities into your account. If you are unable to meet the margin call, your firm will sell your securities to increase the equity in your account up to or above the firm&rsquo;s maintenance requirement.</p><p>Always remember that your broker may not be required to make a margin call or otherwise tell you that your account has fallen below the firm&rsquo;s maintenance requirement. Your broker may be able to sell your securities at any time without consulting you first. Under most margin agreements, even if your firm offers to give you time to increase the equity in your account, it can sell your securities without waiting for you to meet the margin call.</p>

The rules require you to have at least 25 percent of the total market value of the securities in your margin account at all times. The 25 percent is called the &ldquo;maintenance requirement.&rdquo; In fact, many brokerage firms have higher maintenance requirements, typically between 30 to 40 percent, and sometimes higher depending on the type of stock purchased.</p>

This may include taxes, selling assets, and the like.</p><p>Revenue bonds, meanwhile, are backed by the income generated by whatever project or service being funded. If, for example, the revenue bond is going toward maintaining a park, then a portion of the cost of admission may be used to pay off the bond. The interest paid out by both bonds is exempt from federal taxes, and if you invest in bonds issued by the state in which you reside, then you don&rsquo;t have to pay state or local taxes either.

This diversification makes you a more resilient investor by virtue of the fact that all your eggs are no longer in one basket.</p><h4>Time savings</h4><p>Not only do you build a diverse portfolio with a single transaction, but you also save time since the mutual fund is managed by professionals.</p><h4>Potential outperformance</h4><p>Since mutual funds are a business, the people managing your funds want you to beat the market so that they can attract more potential investors and have a greater pool of resources to work with.

    <h2>Mutual Funds Drawbacks</h2>
    <p><p>The pros of mutual funds must be weighed against their cons.</p><h4>Fees</h4><p>All the work that it takes to maintain mutual funds doesn&rsquo;t pay for itself. For this reason, mutual funds often come bundled with fees that are greater than that of many other forms of investment. The question becomes, then, Do you think the potential profit is worth the cost?</p><h4>Historical underperformance</h4><p>Some, but not all, mutual funds over-perform. That said, more than a large percentage of mutual funds have fallen short of their stated goals in the past 15 years. That means, unfortunately, that too many investors end up paying more in fees than other forms of investment only to lose to the market. For this reason, some experts propose investing in index funds, which have lower fees but can tend to outperform mutual funds in some cases.</p><h4>Tax inefficiency</h4><p>Managing a mutual fund entails buying and selling stocks with regular frequency. This creates a taxable event, which means you now have to deal with capital gains taxes, which can eat away at your profits. Unless you&rsquo;re working with a tax-advantaged account, you&rsquo;re going to have to pay taxes on your investment every year.&rdquo;</p>

    <h2>Mutual Funds: How do they work?</h2>
    <p><p>When the value of your mutual fund goes up, you make money. The money you make can then be reinvested into the mutual fund so that you have even more shares. When those shares make more money, you can reinvest again so that you get a greater share of the profit. This process can continue up to the point when you decide to sell your shares.</p>

    <p><p>An option is a contract that gives you the option to buy or sell a stock at a particular price by a given date. Importantly, you are buying the contact and not the stock. You can follow through on the contract, sell them to a different investor, or just let them expire. Options make money when the market rate of the stock becomes less than what it was when you entered the contract. If the stock costs more, you don&rsquo;t actually have to buy the stock.</p>

    <p><p>FINRA rules define a pattern day trader as any customer who executes four or more day trades within five business days, provided that the number of day trades represents more than six percent of the customers total trades in the margin account for that same five business day period. This rule represents a minimum requirement, and some broker-dealers use a slightly broader definition in determining whether a customer qualifies as a pattern day trader. Customers should contact their brokerage firms to determine whether their trading activities will cause them to be designated as pattern day traders.</p><p>A broker-dealer may also designate a customer as a pattern day trader if it knows or has a reasonable basis to believe that a customer will engage in pattern day trading. For example, if a customers broker-dealer provided day trading training to such customer before opening the account, the broker-dealer could designate that customer as a pattern day trader.</p><p>Under FINRA rules, customers who are deemed pattern day traders must have at least $25,000 in their accounts and can only trade in margin accounts. For more information on pattern day traders and related FINRA margin rules, please read the SEC staffs investor bulletin <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/daytrading.pdf" rel="nofollow">Margin Rules for Day Trading</a>.</p>

    <h2>Reverse Stock Split</h2>
    <p><p>When a company completes a reverse stock split, each outstanding share of the company is converted into a fraction of a share. For example, if a company declares a one for ten reverse stock split, every ten shares that you own will be converted into a single share. If you owned 10,000 shares of the company before the reverse stock split, you will own a total of 1,000 shares after the reverse stock split.</p><p>A company may declare a reverse stock split in an effort to increase the trading price of its shares  for example, when it believes the trading price is too low to attract investors to purchase shares, or in an attempt to regain compliance with minimum bid price requirements of an exchange on which its shares trade. In some reverse stock splits, small shareholders are &ldquo;&rdquo;cashed out&rdquo;&rdquo; (receiving a proportionate amount of cash in lieu of partial shares) so that they no longer own the companys shares. Investors may lose money as a result of fluctuations in trading prices following reverse stock splits.</p><p>Although the SEC has authority over a broad range of corporate activity, state corporate law and a companys articles of incorporation and by-laws generally govern the companys ability to declare a reverse stock split and whether shareholder approval is required.&rdquo;</p>

    <h2>Risk Tolerance</h2>
    <p><p>Risk tolerance is how much risk you&rsquo;re willing or able to take on as an investor. Setting aside how much risk you can stomach emotionally, if youve got very little financial wiggle room then youve got low-risk tolerance. Some factors used in calculating risk tolerance include how much time you have for your investments to grow, how much you expect your income to grow, your current and future forecasted expenses, and your health status. If you have a big salary and years until retirement then you have a high-risk tolerance; if you&rsquo;re living paycheck to paycheck you have low-risk tolerance.</p>

    <h2>Short Selling</h2>
    <p><p>A short sale is the sale of a stock that an investor does not own or a sale which is consummated by the delivery of a stock borrowed by, or for the account of, the investor. Short sales are normally settled by the delivery of a security borrowed by or on behalf of the investor. The investor later closes out the position by returning the borrowed security to the stock lender, typically by purchasing securities on the open market.</p><p>Investors who sell stock short typically believe the price of the stock will fall and hope to buy the stock at the lower price and make a profit. Short selling is also used by market makers and others to provide liquidity in response to unanticipated demand, or to hedge the risk of an economic long position in the same security or in a related security. If the price of the stock rises, short sellers who buy it at the higher price will incur a loss.</p><p>Brokerage firms typically lend stock to customers who engage in short sales, using the firms own inventory, the margin account of another of the firms customers, or another lender. As with buying stock on margin, short sellers are subject to the margin rules and other fees and charges may apply (including interest on the stock loan). If the borrowed stock pays a dividend, the short seller is responsible for paying the dividend to the person or firm making the loan.&rdquo;</p>

Since the interest will be paid out at various points, its unlikely that the interest will be reinvested all at once. This means that the return on investment wont be 100% aligned with its face value. Calculating the YTM can be time-consuming, so its best to use either spreadsheet software or a financial calculator to do the work for you.</p>

<b>All investments</b> involve the risk of loss and the past performance of a security or a financial product does not guarantee future results or returns. You should consult your legal, tax, or financial advisors before making any financial decisions. This material is not intended as a recommendation, offer, or solicitation to purchase or sell securities, open a brokerage account, or engage in any investment strategy.</p>
<p><b>Securities, Options, Bonds.</b><br />
Self-directed brokerage accounts and brokerage services for US-listed, registered securities, options, and bonds, except for treasury securities offered through Jiko Securities, Inc., are offered to self-directed customers by Open to the Public Investing, Inc. (“Public Investing”), a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>. Additional information about your broker can be found by clicking <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>. Public Investing is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Public Holdings, Inc. (“Public Holdings”). This is not an offer, solicitation of an offer, or advice to buy or sell securities or open a brokerage account in any jurisdiction where Public Investing is not registered. Securities products offered by Public Investing are not FDIC insured. Apex Clearing Corporation, our clearing firm, has additional insurance coverage in excess of the regular <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a> limits. Additional information can be found <a href="https://help.public.com/en/articles/6594797-frequently-asked-questions-sipc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>
<b>Options.</b><br />
Options trading entails significant risk and is not suitable for all investors. Options investors can rapidly lose the value of their investment in a short period of time and incur permanent loss by expiration date. Certain complex options strategies carry additional risk and costs. Investors must read and understand the <a href="https://www.theocc.com/company-information/documents-and-archives/options-disclosure-document">Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options</a> before considering any options transaction. Index options have special features and fees that should be carefully considered, including settlement, exercise, expiration, tax, and cost characteristics. See <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/fee-schedule">Fee Schedule</a> for all options trading fees.  Supporting documentation for any claims will be furnished upon request. To learn more about options rebates, see terms of the <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/rebate-terms">Options Rebate Program</a>. Rebate rates vary monthly from $0.06-$0.18 and depend on your current and prior month’s options trading volume. Rates are subject to change at any time.</p>
<p>
<b>Bonds.</b><br />
“Bonds” shall refer to corporate debt securities and U.S. government securities offered on the Public platform through a self-directed brokerage account held at Public Investing and custodied at Apex Clearing.  For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude  treasury securities held in  treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “Treasury Accounts” section.</p>
<p>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors.  The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa.  Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk.  All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change.  Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond's credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned.  Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.</p>
<p><em>A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond. Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/fee-schedule">Fee Schedule</a></em>.</p>
<p>
<em>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account.  The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</em></p>
<p><em>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages. Read more about the risks associated with <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/fixed-income-disclosure">fixed income</a> and <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/apex-fractional-bond-disclosure">fractional bonds</a>. See <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/bond-account">Bond Account Disclosures</a> to learn more.</em></p>
<p><b id="disclosures-etf-etp">ETFs & ETPs.</b><br />
Before investing in an ETF, you should read the prospectus carefully, which provides detailed information on the fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses and unique risk profile. Prospectuses can be found on the ETF issuer's website.  All investments involve risks, including the loss of principal. Performance data represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate such that an investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost.</p>
<p>A spot bitcoin exchange-traded product (“ETP”) is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) and is not subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (the “CEA”). As a result, shareholders do not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the 1940 Act or the protections afforded by the CEA.  The performance of a spot bitcoin ETP will not reflect the specific return an investor would realize if the investor actually purchased bitcoin. Investors will not have any rights that bitcoin holders have and will not have the right to receive any redemption proceeds in bitcoin.  Digital assets like Bitcoin are highly speculative and may be subject to increased risk of price volatility, illiquidity, market manipulation, and loss, including loss of your entire investment.</p>
<p>
<b>Margin Accounts.</b><br />
Margin investing increases your level of risk and has the potential to magnify your losses, including loss of more than your initial investment.   Please assess your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial circumstances to determine whether margin is appropriate for you.  You must repay your margin debt regardless of the underlying value of the securities you purchased.  Public Investing can change its maintenance margin requirements at any time without prior notice.  If the equity in your margin account falls below the minimum maintenance requirements, you may be required to deposit additional cash or securities.  If you are unable to do so, Public Investing may sell some or all of your securities, without prior approval or notice.  You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call.  For more information please see Public Investing’s <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/margin-disclosure-statement">Margin Disclosure Statement</a>, <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/apex-margin-agreement">Margin Agreement</a>, and <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/fee-schedule">Fee Schedule</a>.</p>
<p>
<b id="disclosures-hyca">High-Yield Cash Account.</b><br />
A High-Yield Cash Account is a secondary brokerage account with Public Investing. Funds in your High-Yield Cash Account are automatically deposited into partner banks (“Partner Banks”), where that cash earns interest and is eligible for FDIC insurance. See <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/high-yield-account/partners-list">here</a> for a list of current Partner Banks. Your Annual Percentage Yield is variable and may change at the discretion of the Partner Banks or Public Investing. Apex Clearing and Public Investing receive administrative fees for operating this program, which reduce the amount of interest paid on swept cash.  Neither Public Investing nor any of its affiliates is a bank. <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/high-yield-account">Learn more</a>.</p>
<p>
<b>Cryptocurrency.</b><br />
Cryptocurrency trading, execution, and custody services are provided by Bakkt Crypto Solutions, LLC (NMLS ID 1828849) (“Bakkt”). Cryptocurrency is highly speculative, involves a high degree of risk, and has the potential for loss of the entire amount of an investment. Cryptocurrencies offered by Bakkt are not securities and are not FDIC insured or protected by <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>. Your cryptocurrency assets are held in your Bakkt account. Bakkt is a licensed virtual currency business by the New York State Department of Financial Services and a licensed money transmitter, but is not a registered broker-dealer or a <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> member. Your Bakkt Crypto account is separate from your brokerage account with Public Investing, which holds US-listed stocks and ETFs. Please review the <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/bakkt-crypto-risk-disclosure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Risk Disclosures</a> before trading.</p>
<p>
<b id="disclosures-treasuries">Treasury Accounts.</b><br />
Investing services in treasury accounts offering 6 month US Treasury Bills on the Public platform are through Jiko Securities, Inc. (“JSI”), a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>. See JSI’s <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/287507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA BrokerCheck</a> and <a href="https://jiko.io/docs/JikoSecuritiesFormCRS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Form CRS</a> for further information.<br />
JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity).  T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.”  Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash.  The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity.  T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance.  Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk.  As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates.  Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment. <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/jiko-treasuries-risk-disclosure" target="_blank">Jiko U.S. Treasuries Risk Disclosures</a> for further details.</p>
<p><b style="font-size: 115%;">Investments in T-bills: Not FDIC Insured; No Bank Guarantee; May Lose Value. </b></p>
<p>Banking services and bank accounts are offered by Jiko Bank, a division of Mid-Central National Bank.<br />
JSI and Jiko Bank are not affiliated with Public Holdings, Inc. (“Public”) or any of its subsidiaries.  None of these entities provide legal, tax, or accounting advice.  You should consult your legal, tax, or financial advisors before making any financial decisions. This material is not intended as a recommendation, offer, or solicitation to purchase or sell securities, open a brokerage account, or engage in any investment strategy.</p>
<p><b>Commission-free</b> trading  refers to $0 commissions charged on trades of US listed registered securities placed during the US Markets Regular Trading Hours in self-directed brokerage accounts offered by Public Investing. Keep in mind that other fees such as regulatory fees, Premium subscription fees, commissions on trades during extended trading hours, wire transfer fees, and paper statement fees may apply to your brokerage account.

<p><b id="disclosures-investment-plans">Investment Plans.</b> Investment Plans (“Plans”) shown in our marketplace are for informational purposes only and are meant as helpful starting points as you discover, research and create a Plan that meets your specific investing needs. Plans are self-directed purchases of individually-selected assets, which may include stocks, ETFs and cryptocurrency. Plans are not recommendations of a Plan overall or its individual holdings or default allocations. Plans are created using defined, objective criteria based on generally accepted investment theory; they are not based on your needs or risk profile. You are responsible for establishing and maintaining allocations among assets within your Plan. Plans involve continuous investments, regardless of market conditions. Diversification does not eliminate risk.
