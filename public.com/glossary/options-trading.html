    <h2>Adjustments</h2>
    <p><p>An adjustment is a change to the terms of an options contract due to a corporate action such as a merger, stock split, dividend, acquisition, spin-off, or similar event. These changes can affect critical elements like the strike price, deliverable, expiration date, and multiplier. When a stock split, for instance, occurs (say, a 3-for-2 split), an adjusted option would represent 150 shares instead of the usual 100. Consequently, the premium needs adjusting too; purchasing one call (now covering 150 shares) at $4 would cost $600 due to the altered share quantity.</p>

    <h2>At-the-money / At-the-money option</h2>
    <p><p>An at-the-money (ATM) option is an option contract where the strike price (the predetermined price at which the underlying asset can be bought or sold) is equal to the current market price of the underlying asset. This means that the option has no intrinsic value, as the holder can neither buy nor sell the underlying asset at a profit immediately. It&rsquo;s a crucial point for options traders as the price movement from this position determines whether the option will gain or lose value.</p>

    <h2>Backspread</h2>
    <p><p>A backspread is an options trading strategy involving buying more long options than short options on the same underlying asset, with the same expiration date but different strike prices. This creates a position with reduced sensitivity to minor fluctuations in the underlying asset&rsquo;s price (known as delta neutrality). However, different types of backspreads (e.g., call backspread, put backspread) can be used to limit potential gains in one direction while limiting potential losses in the other, depending on the market expectations and desired outcome.</p>

Ideal conditions for profit include no time decay, no transaction costs, no dividends, and perfectly flat price movement within the strike price range. An example of a box spread would be purchasing 1 XYZ June 60 call and selling 1 XYZ June 65 call, while simultaneously purchasing 1 XYZ June 65 put and selling 1 XYZ June 60 put.</p>

    <h2>Convexity</h2>
    <p><p>Convexity in options is a significant advantage that stems from the dynamic nature of an option&rsquo;s delta concerning changes in the underlying stock&rsquo;s price. When the stock price moves, the delta of an option changes as well, leading to what&rsquo;s known as &ldquo;positive curvature.&rdquo;</p><p>For instance, when a stock drops, a call option&rsquo;s delta decreases. This means that for each subsequent drop in the stock price, the option will lose proportionally less value compared to the initial drop. Conversely, as the stock price increases, a call option&rsquo;s delta rises, allowing the option holder to gain more value for each successive increase in the stock price.</p><p>Convexity can also refer to a strategy in trading or investing where a trader allocates more capital in successive trades during a winning streak and reduces capital allocation during a losing streak. This approach aims to safeguard capital during losses and capitalize more during profitable periods, helping to manage risk and maximize gains over time.</p>

    <h2>Index</h2>
    <p><p>An index is essentially a statistical measure that represents the value of a particular segment of the stock market. It&rsquo;s generally composed of a basket of stocks that represent a particular sector, market, or industry. The S&amp;P 100 Index, for instance, represents the performance of 100 major companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges.</p>

    <h2>Index fund</h2>
    <p><p>An index fund aims to replicate the performance of a specific market index, like the S&amp;P 500 or the Nasdaq Composite, by holding the same stocks in the same proportions as the index. This passive investment strategy often offers lower fees due to minimal active management.</p>

    <h2>Index option</h2>
    <p><p>An index option gives the holder the right to buy or sell an index at a specific price within a certain timeframe.

    <h2>Individual volatility</h2>
    <p><p>A theoretical statistical measure of the expected future price fluctuations of an underlying asset, used to price an option based on a specific model. By inputting the current option price along with five other known factors (underlying asset price, time to expiration, strike price, interest rate, and dividends), theoretical pricing models can calculate the individual volatility required to justify that specific option price. This value helps calibrate pricing models to reflect market conditions and analyze option pricing discrepancies compared to real-world prices. However, it&rsquo;s important to remember that individual volatility is a theoretical concept and relies on model assumptions, potentially leading to inaccuracies compared to actual market behavior.</p>

    <h2>Leverage</h2>
    <p><p>Leverage refers to the ability to control a greater asset value (e.g., 100 shares of stock) by investing a smaller amount (e.g., the premium of a call option).

While leverage can be an attractive tool for boosting returns, it&rsquo;s crucial to understand its risks and costs. Remember, leverage isn&rsquo;t limited to options; it applies to various financial instruments, each with its own risk profile and cost considerations. Prudent risk management and thorough analysis are essential for effectively utilizing leverage within your investment strategy.</p>

    <h2>Ninety-ten (90/10) strategy</h2>
    <p><p>The 90/10 strategy is a conservative investment approach favored for its focus on capital preservation and income generation.

This provides a stable foundation and consistent income through interest or dividends. The remaining 10% is invested in call options on equities or other protected investment strategies. This small allocation offers potential for limited upside gains from the options while minimizing risk due to the large buffer provided by the 90% allocation. The specific asset choices and option strategies within the 90/10 framework can be adjusted based on individual risk tolerance, prevailing interest rates, and market conditions. This flexibility, along with its focus on risk management, makes the 90/10 strategy a popular choice for conservative investors seeking income and some potential for growth while protecting their capital.</p>

    <h2>Option</h2>
    <p><p>An option is a contract between two parties that grants the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specific asset at a predetermined price by a specific date. In simpler terms, it&rsquo;s like buying the opportunity to make a future trade. There are two main types of options: calls, which give the right to buy, and puts, which give the right to sell.</p>

<b>All investments</b> involve the risk of loss and the past performance of a security or a financial product does not guarantee future results or returns. You should consult your legal, tax, or financial advisors before making any financial decisions. This material is not intended as a recommendation, offer, or solicitation to purchase or sell securities, open a brokerage account, or engage in any investment strategy.</p>
<p><b>Securities, Options, Bonds.</b><br />
Self-directed brokerage accounts and brokerage services for US-listed, registered securities, options, and bonds, except for treasury securities offered through Jiko Securities, Inc., are offered to self-directed customers by Open to the Public Investing, Inc. (“Public Investing”), a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>. Additional information about your broker can be found by clicking <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>. Public Investing is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Public Holdings, Inc. (“Public Holdings”). This is not an offer, solicitation of an offer, or advice to buy or sell securities or open a brokerage account in any jurisdiction where Public Investing is not registered. Securities products offered by Public Investing are not FDIC insured. Apex Clearing Corporation, our clearing firm, has additional insurance coverage in excess of the regular <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a> limits. Additional information can be found <a href="https://help.public.com/en/articles/6594797-frequently-asked-questions-sipc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>
<b>Options.</b><br />
Options trading entails significant risk and is not suitable for all investors. Options investors can rapidly lose the value of their investment in a short period of time and incur permanent loss by expiration date. Certain complex options strategies carry additional risk and costs. Investors must read and understand the <a href="https://www.theocc.com/company-information/documents-and-archives/options-disclosure-document">Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options</a> before considering any options transaction. Index options have special features and fees that should be carefully considered, including settlement, exercise, expiration, tax, and cost characteristics. See <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/fee-schedule">Fee Schedule</a> for all options trading fees.  Supporting documentation for any claims will be furnished upon request. To learn more about options rebates, see terms of the <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/rebate-terms">Options Rebate Program</a>. Rebate rates vary monthly from $0.06-$0.18 and depend on your current and prior month’s options trading volume. Rates are subject to change at any time.</p>
<p>
<b>Bonds.</b><br />
“Bonds” shall refer to corporate debt securities and U.S. government securities offered on the Public platform through a self-directed brokerage account held at Public Investing and custodied at Apex Clearing.  For purposes of this section, Bonds exclude  treasury securities held in  treasury accounts with Jiko Securities, Inc. as explained under the “Treasury Accounts” section.</p>
<p>Investments in Bonds are subject to various risks including risks related to interest rates, credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors.  The value of Bonds fluctuate and any investments sold prior to maturity may result in gain or loss of principal. In general, when interest rates go up, Bond prices typically drop, and vice versa.  Bonds with higher yields or offered by issuers with lower credit ratings generally carry a higher degree of risk.  All fixed income securities are subject to price change and availability, and yield is subject to change.  Bond ratings, if provided, are third party opinions on the overall bond's credit worthiness at the time the rating is assigned.  Ratings are not recommendations to purchase, hold, or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes.</p>
<p><em>A Bond Account is a self-directed brokerage account with Public Investing. Deposits into this account are used to purchase 10 investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The Bond Account’s yield is the average, annualized yield to worst (YTW) across all ten bonds in the Bond Account, before fees. A bond’s yield is a function of its market price, which can fluctuate; therefore a bond’s YTW is not “locked in” until the bond is purchased, and your yield at time of purchase may be different from the yield shown here. The “locked in” YTW is not guaranteed; you may receive less than the YTW of the bonds in the Bond Account if you sell any of the bonds before maturity or if the issuer defaults on the bond. Public Investing charges a markup on each bond trade. See our <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/fee-schedule">Fee Schedule</a></em>.</p>
<p>
<em>Bond Accounts are not recommendations of individual bonds or default allocations. The bonds in the Bond Account have not been selected based on your needs or risk profile. You should evaluate each bond before investing in a Bond Account.  The bonds in your Bond Account will not be rebalanced and allocations will not be updated, except for Corporate Actions.</em></p>
<p><em>Fractional Bonds also carry additional risks including that they are only available on Public and cannot be transferred to other brokerages. Read more about the risks associated with <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/fixed-income-disclosure">fixed income</a> and <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/apex-fractional-bond-disclosure">fractional bonds</a>. See <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/bond-account">Bond Account Disclosures</a> to learn more.</em></p>
<p><b id="disclosures-etf-etp">ETFs & ETPs.</b><br />
Before investing in an ETF, you should read the prospectus carefully, which provides detailed information on the fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses and unique risk profile. Prospectuses can be found on the ETF issuer's website.  All investments involve risks, including the loss of principal. Performance data represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate such that an investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost.</p>
<p>A spot bitcoin exchange-traded product (“ETP”) is not an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”) and is not subject to regulation under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (the “CEA”). As a result, shareholders do not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the 1940 Act or the protections afforded by the CEA.  The performance of a spot bitcoin ETP will not reflect the specific return an investor would realize if the investor actually purchased bitcoin. Investors will not have any rights that bitcoin holders have and will not have the right to receive any redemption proceeds in bitcoin.  Digital assets like Bitcoin are highly speculative and may be subject to increased risk of price volatility, illiquidity, market manipulation, and loss, including loss of your entire investment.</p>
<p>
<b>Margin Accounts.</b><br />
Margin investing increases your level of risk and has the potential to magnify your losses, including loss of more than your initial investment.   Please assess your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial circumstances to determine whether margin is appropriate for you.  You must repay your margin debt regardless of the underlying value of the securities you purchased.  Public Investing can change its maintenance margin requirements at any time without prior notice.  If the equity in your margin account falls below the minimum maintenance requirements, you may be required to deposit additional cash or securities.  If you are unable to do so, Public Investing may sell some or all of your securities, without prior approval or notice.  You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call.  For more information please see Public Investing’s <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/margin-disclosure-statement">Margin Disclosure Statement</a>, <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/apex-margin-agreement">Margin Agreement</a>, and <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/fee-schedule">Fee Schedule</a>.</p>
<p>
<b id="disclosures-hyca">High-Yield Cash Account.</b><br />
A High-Yield Cash Account is a secondary brokerage account with Public Investing. Funds in your High-Yield Cash Account are automatically deposited into partner banks (“Partner Banks”), where that cash earns interest and is eligible for FDIC insurance. See <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/high-yield-account/partners-list">here</a> for a list of current Partner Banks. Your Annual Percentage Yield is variable and may change at the discretion of the Partner Banks or Public Investing. Apex Clearing and Public Investing receive administrative fees for operating this program, which reduce the amount of interest paid on swept cash.  Neither Public Investing nor any of its affiliates is a bank. <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/high-yield-account">Learn more</a>.</p>
<p>
<b>Cryptocurrency.</b><br />
Cryptocurrency trading, execution, and custody services are provided by Bakkt Crypto Solutions, LLC (NMLS ID 1828849) (“Bakkt”). Cryptocurrency is highly speculative, involves a high degree of risk, and has the potential for loss of the entire amount of an investment. Cryptocurrencies offered by Bakkt are not securities and are not FDIC insured or protected by <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>. Your cryptocurrency assets are held in your Bakkt account. Bakkt is a licensed virtual currency business by the New York State Department of Financial Services and a licensed money transmitter, but is not a registered broker-dealer or a <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> member. Your Bakkt Crypto account is separate from your brokerage account with Public Investing, which holds US-listed stocks and ETFs. Please review the <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/bakkt-crypto-risk-disclosure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Risk Disclosures</a> before trading.</p>
<p>
<b id="disclosures-treasuries">Treasury Accounts.</b><br />
Investing services in treasury accounts offering 6 month US Treasury Bills on the Public platform are through Jiko Securities, Inc. (“JSI”), a registered broker-dealer and member of <a href="https://www.finra.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA</a> & <a href="https://www.sipc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">SIPC</a>. See JSI’s <a href="https://brokercheck.finra.org/firm/summary/287507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">FINRA BrokerCheck</a> and <a href="https://jiko.io/docs/JikoSecuritiesFormCRS.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Form CRS</a> for further information.<br />
JSI uses funds from your Treasury Account to purchase T-bills in increments of $100 “par value” (the T-bill’s value at maturity).  T-bills are purchased at a discount to the par value and the T-bill’s yield represents the difference in price between the “par value” and the “discount price.”  Aggregate funds in your Treasury Account in excess of the T-bill purchases will remain in your Treasury Account as cash.  The value of T-bills fluctuate and investors may receive more or less than their original investments if sold prior to maturity.  T-bills are subject to price change and availability - yield is subject to change. Past performance is not indicative of future performance.  Investments in T-bills involve a variety of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk.  As a general rule, the price of a T-bills moves inversely to changes in interest rates.  Although T-bills are considered safer than many other financial instruments, you could lose all or a part of your investment. <a href="https://public.com/disclosures/jiko-treasuries-risk-disclosure" target="_blank">Jiko U.S. Treasuries Risk Disclosures</a> for further details.</p>
<p><b style="font-size: 115%;">Investments in T-bills: Not FDIC Insured; No Bank Guarantee; May Lose Value. </b></p>
