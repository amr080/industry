Beam is a web3 payments platform that enables payouts to and from web3 blockchain accounts. Beam is one of our core products which enables our users (“<strong>User</strong>”) to transfer digital assets, access liquidity for the conversion of digital assets to fiat currencies and instruct transfers to and from your bank accounts or Wallets (defined below). By agreeing to these Terms, you are explicitly giving M-Cubed Labs permission to act on your behalf and fulfill orders as instructed. We retain full discretion to refuse to accept any User or to complete any instruction to transfer, send, withdraw, or convert digital assets held in your Wallet or account at any time.</li><li>Balances. Beam is a service that we offer via our partner ZeroHash LLC (“<strong>ZeroHash</strong>”). By agreeing to these Terms, you are also agreeing to ZeroHash Terms and Conditions available at <a href="http://www.zerohash.com/ansible">http://www.zerohash.com/ansible. </a>Users must register using their email address and connect a deposit Wallet address via Beam in order to get access to the Services.

In order to transact via Beam, Users must first input their card information or connect their bank account and select a destination wallet or account for payouts from Beam. Beam will convert User digital assets such as ETH or USDC (such digital assets, “<strong>Approved Digital Assets</strong>”) to USD per the User’s transaction instructions upon Beam receiving the Approved Digital Assets necessary to facilitate the transactions. Funds typically arrive in the User’s selected bank account within three (3) business days depending on the payment selected and whether your bank supports real-time deposits. We have no control over the precise timing of when such transactions settle with the User’s bank.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Connecting to Beam</strong><ul role="list" class="list-rim"><li>You must connect a compliant digital asset wallet as provided on the M-Cubed Labs site as may be necessary for M-Cubed Labs to transfer Approved Digital Assets (“<strong>Wallet</strong>”) and authorize M-Cubed Labs to transfer your transaction details that you may effectuate via your Wallet in order to use certain features of Beam.

To protect your account, keep the account details and password confidential, and notify us right away of any unauthorized use. You’re responsible for all activities that occur under your account and are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any financial information related to your Wallet.</li><li>You may deactivate or delete your account at any time, for any reason.

Network transaction fees change, often unpredictably, and their price is entirely outside of the control of M-Cubed Labs. Although we attempt to provide accurate fee information, this information reflects our estimates of fees, which may vary from the actual fees paid to use the Site and interact with the blockchain networks. You acknowledge that under no circumstances will a transaction be invalidated, revocable, retractable, or otherwise unenforceable on the basis that the gas fee for the given transaction was unknown, too high, or otherwise unacceptable to a User.

M-Cubed Labs does not own or control any of the underlying software through which blockchain networks are formed. In general, the software underlying blockchain networks, including the Ethereum blockchain, is open source, such that anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute it.</li><li>You acknowledge and agree (a) that M-Cubed Labs is not responsible for the operation of the software and networks underlying the Site, (b) that there exists no guarantee of the functionality, security, or availability of that software and networks, and (c) that the underlying networks are subject to sudden changes in operating rules, such as those commonly referred to as “forks,” which may materially affect the Site.</li><li>You understand Beam does not store, send, or receive digital assets. Any transfer of digital assets occurs within the supporting blockchain and not on the Site. Some transactions in digital assets shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that you initiated the transaction.</li><li>You understand blockchain networks use public/private key cryptography. You alone are responsible for securing any of your private key(s) when you interact with funds using self-custodial wallet software. We do not have access to your private key(s) for self-custodial wallet software. Losing control of your private key(s) will permanently and irreversibly deny you access to digital assets on blockchain-based networks. Neither M-Cubed Labs nor any other person or entity will be able to retrieve or protect your digital assets stored with the assistance of self-custodial wallet software. If your private key(s) are lost, then you will not be able to transfer your digital assets to any other blockchain address or wallet. If this occurs, then you will not be able to realize any value or utility from the digital assets that you may hold.</li><li>You understand the Site and your digital assets could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions, which could impede or limit the ability of M-Cubed Labs to continue to make available any portion(s) of the Site which rely on any M-Cubed Labs proprietary software and, thus, could impede or limit your ability to access or use the Site.</li><li>A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the development of those ecosystems and related applications, and could therefore also negatively impact the potential utility or value of any digital assets.</li><li>You acknowledge and understand that cryptography is a progressing field with advances in code cracking or other technical advancements, such as the development of quantum computers, which may present risks to digital assets and the Site and could result in the theft or loss of your digital assets. To the extent possible, we intend to update the smart contracts related to the Site to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures necessary to address risks presented from technological advancements. We may also freeze the platform in the event of a critical security problem, but this does not guarantee or otherwise ensure full security of the Site.</li><li>You understand that blockchain networks such as the Ethereum blockchain remain under development, which creates technological and security risks when using the Site in addition to uncertainty relating to digital assets and transactions therein. You acknowledge that the prices and liquidity of digital assets are extremely volatile, and the cost of transacting on blockchain networks is variable and may increase at any time causing impact to any activities taking place on the blockchain networks, which may result in price fluctuations or increased costs when using the Site.</li><li>You acknowledge that the Site is subject to flaws and that you are solely responsible for evaluating any code provided by the Site. This warning and others M-Cubed Labs provide in these Terms in no way evidence or represent an on-going duty to alert you to all of the potential risks of using or accessing the Site.</li><li>You understand that although we intend to provide accurate and timely information on the Site, the Site and other information available when using the Site may not always be entirely accurate, complete, or current and may also include technical inaccuracies or typographical errors.

No representation is made as to the accuracy, completeness, or appropriateness for any particular purpose of any pricing information distributed via the Site. Prices and pricing information may be higher or lower than prices available on platforms providing similar services.</li><li>You understand any use or interaction with the Site requires a comprehensive understanding of applied cryptography and computer science to appreciate the inherent risks, including those listed above. You represent and warrant that you possess relevant knowledge and skills. Any reference to a type of digital asset on the Site does not indicate our approval or disapproval of the technology on which the digital asset relies and should not be used as a substitute for your understanding of the risks specific to each type of digital asset.</li><li>You understand blockchain-based transactions entered into in connection with the Site are irreversible, final and there are no refunds.

You accept all consequences of using the Site. All transaction decisions are made solely by you.

It is part of your contract with M-Cubed Labs and affects your rights. It contains procedures for mandatory binding arbitration and a class action waiver.<ul role="list" class="list-unmark"><li><strong>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</strong> All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) between M-Cubed Labs and any User that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved solely by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, and not in a class, representative, or consolidated action or proceeding. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and M-Cubed Labs, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights at any time.</li><li><strong>Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. </strong>Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“<strong>Notice</strong>”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. Each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to service of process through personal service at their corporate headquarters, registered address, or primary address (for individuals or sole proprietors). Nothing in these Terms will affect the right of any party to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law. After the Notice is received, you and M-Cubed Labs must first attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. Neither you nor M-Cubed Labs may start a formal arbitration proceeding for at least sixty (60) days after one party notifies the other party of a claim in writing. If you and M-Cubed Labs do not resolve the claim or dispute within sixty (60) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.</li><li><strong>Arbitration Rules.</strong> Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“<strong>ADR Provider</strong>”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“<strong>Arbitration Rules</strong>”) governing the arbitration are available online at <a href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance- based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time, and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that M-Cubed Labs made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, M-Cubed Labs will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.</li><li><strong>Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration.</strong> If non- appearance-based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.</li><li><strong>Time Limits.</strong> If you or M-Cubed Labs pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.</li><li><strong>Authority of Arbitrator.</strong> If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and M-Cubed Labs, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and M-Cubed Labs.</li><li><strong>Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong> THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, INSTEAD ELECTING THAT ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES SHALL BE RESOLVED BY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. ARBITRATION PROCEDURES ARE TYPICALLY MORE LIMITED, MORE EFFICIENT AND LESS COSTLY THAN RULES APPLICABLE IN A COURT AND ARE SUBJECT TO VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT. IN THE EVENT ANY LITIGATION SHOULD ARISE BETWEEN YOU AND M-CUBED LABS IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT IN A SUIT TO VACATE OR ENFORCE AN ARBITRATION AWARD OR OTHERWISE, YOU WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, INSTEAD ELECTING THAT THE DISPUTE BE RESOLVED BY A JUDGE.</li><li><strong>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. </strong>ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER USER.</li><li><strong>Confidentiality. </strong>All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.</li><li><strong>Severability.</strong> If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</li><li><strong>Right to Waive.</strong> Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.</li><li><strong>Survival of Agreement. </strong>This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with M-Cubed Labs.</li><li><strong>Small Claims Court. </strong>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or M-Cubed Labs may bring an individual action in small claims court.</li><li><strong>Emergency Equitable Relief. </strong>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.</li><li><strong>Claims Not Subject to Arbitration.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.</li><li><strong>Courts. </strong>In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San Francisco, California for such purpose.</li></ul></li></ol></li><li><strong>Governing Law</strong><ol role="list" class="list-rim"><li>The interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and any dispute related to these Terms or the Site, will be governed by and construed and enforced under the laws of the State of California, as applicable, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the State of California or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.
