Our Services require the use of  a digital wallet provided through third party services that we do not own and control. These digital  wallets enable you to take self-custody and manage digital assets (for example, cryptocurrencies  and non-fungible token (or “NFTs&quot;) that we may support, and enable you to interact with third  party services and supported Protocols and support the sale, purchase, trade and distribution of  digital assets on the decentralized blockchains on which the supported digital assets are recorded  (each, a “Blockchain”).  </p><p>If you participate in our Services relating to the management of digital assetsmart contracts will  be employed that necessarily collect information, such as your digital wallet address (which some  legal jurisdictions may consider personal information), and that information will be stored on a  public blockchain that we do not control. A smart contract is computer code that automatically  processes events when certain conditions are met; for example, when a transaction is conducted  between two individuals or entities where each sign off to conduct a financial transaction (in other  words, settle the accounts between individuals to be then broadcast to the blockchain) or when a  user wants to add an NFT to a digital wallet, a smart contract would automatically execute the  proposed action. In these situations, your personal information will be stored on that blockchain  through the execution of a smart contract and that personal information may not be able to be  modified or deleted due to the immutable nature of the blockchain. </p><p>‍</p><p class="p-center"><strong>YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU MAY BE BROADCASTING TO  THE BLOCKCHAIN.</strong></p><p>Please make sure to review our Terms of Service for more information, including specific terms  and obligations for the use of our Services that may include dispute resolutions. </p><p id="personal-info"><strong>2.0 Personal Information Collected  </strong></p><p>The categories of personal information we collect depend on how you interact with us, our  Services, and the requirements of applicable law.
