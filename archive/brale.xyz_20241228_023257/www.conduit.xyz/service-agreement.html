Customer is responsible for the use of the Services by any Authorized User and any other person to whom Customer has given access to the Services, even if Customer did not authorize such use. </li><li>If Customer is a controller or processor of personal data subject to (i) the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (the “<strong>EU GDPR</strong>”) and the EU GDPR as it forms part of the law of England and Wales by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “<strong>UK GDPR</strong>” and, collectively with the EU GDPR, the “<strong>GDPR</strong>”), (ii) a controller or processor of personal data subject to the  Virginia Data Consumer Data Protection Act (the “<strong>VCDPA</strong>”), or (iii) is a business or service provider of personal information subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (collectively, the “<strong>CCPA</strong>”), then the Data Processing Addendum located at https://conduit.xyz/dpa (as amended from time to time) (the “<strong>DPA</strong>”) applies and is hereby included and incorporated into this Agreement.  </li><li>Customer agrees and acknowledges that Customer Data may be irretrievably deleted if Customer’s account is ninety (90) days or more delinquent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Customer acknowledges and agrees that Conduit may (i) internally use and modify Customer Data for the purposes of (A) providing the Services to Customer and (B) generating Aggregated De-Identified Data (as defined below), and (ii) freely use, retain and make available Aggregated De-Identified Data for Conduit’s business purposes (including without limitation, for purposes of improving, testing, operating, promoting and marketing Conduit’s products and services), where “<strong>Aggregated De-Identified Data</strong>” means data submitted to, collected by, or generated by Conduit in connection with Customer’s use of the Services, but only in aggregate, de-identified form that is not linked specifically to Customer. </li></ol></li><li>Third Party Integrations. Customer acknowledges and agrees that (i) the Services may operate on, with or using application programming interfaces (APIs) and/or other services operated or provided by third parties (e.g., other vendors of Customer) (“<strong>Third Party Integrations</strong>”), (ii) the availability and operation of the Services or certain portions thereof may be dependent on Conduit’s ability to access such Third Party Integrations, and (iii) Customer’s failure to provide adequate access or any retraction of permissions relating to such Third Party Integrations may result in a suspension or interruption of the Services. Customer hereby represents and warrants that it has all rights, licenses, permissions and consents necessary to connect, use and access any Third Party Integrations that it integrates with the Services, and Customer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Conduit for all claims, damages and liabilities arising out of Customer’s use of any Third Party Integrations in connection with or through the Services. Conduit cannot and does not guarantee that the Services shall incorporate (or continue to incorporate) any particular Third Party Integrations and does not make any representations or warranties with respect to Third Party Integrations. Customer is solely responsible for procuring any and all rights necessary for it to access Third Party Integrations (including any Customer Data or other information relating thereto) and for complying with any applicable terms or conditions thereof. Any exchange of data or other interaction between Customer and a third party provider is solely between Customer and such third party provider and is governed by such third party’s terms and conditions.</li><li>Open Source Components. Certain aspects of the Services, such as the Client-Side Software, may contain or be distributed with open source software code or libraries (“<strong>Open Source Components</strong>”). Conduit will provide a list of Open Source Components for a particular version of any distributed portion of the Services, such as the Client-Side Software, on Customer’s request. To the extent required by the license applicable to such Open Source Components: (i) Conduit will use reasonable efforts to deliver to Customer any notices or other materials (such as source code); and (ii) the terms of such licenses will apply to such Open Source Components in lieu of the terms of this Agreement. To the extent the terms of such licenses prohibit any of the restrictions in this Agreement with respect to any particular Open Source Component, such restrictions will not apply to such Open Source Component. To the extent the terms of such licenses require Conduit to make an offer to provide source code or related information in connection with the Open Source Component, such offer is hereby made.</li><li>Term; Termination. <ol role="list"><li>This Agreement shall commence upon the date of the first Order Form, and, unless earlier terminated in accordance herewith, shall last until the expiration of all Order Form Terms. For each Order Form, unless otherwise specified therein, the “<strong>Order Form Term</strong>” shall begin as of the effective date set forth on such Order Form, and unless earlier terminated as set forth herein, (i) shall continue for the initial term specified on such Order Form (the “<strong>Order Form Initial Term</strong>”), and (ii) following the Order Form Initial Term, shall automatically renew for additional successive periods of equal duration to the Order Form Initial Term (each, an “<strong>Order Form Renewal Term</strong>”) unless either party notifies the other party of such party’s intention not to renew no later than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the Order Form Initial Term or then-current Order Form Renewal Term as applicable. Conduit may increase the Fees for any Order Form Renewal Term by providing written notice to Customer at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the then-current Order Form Initial Term or Order Form Renewal Term as applicable. </li><li>In the event of a material breach of this Agreement by either party, the non-breaching party may terminate this Agreement by providing written notice to the breaching party, provided that the breaching party does not materially cure such breach within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice. Without limiting the foregoing, Conduit may terminate, suspend or limit Customer’s and any Authorized User’s access to or use of the Services if (i) Customer’s or any Authorized User’s account is more than sixty (60) days past due, or (ii) Customer’s or any Authorized User’s use of the Services results in (or is reasonably likely to result in) damage to or material degradation of the Services which interferes with Conduit’s ability to provide access to the Services to other customers; provided that in the case of subsection (ii):  (a) prior to any such suspension or limitation, Conduit shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide notice to Customer describing the nature of the damage or degradation; and (b) Conduit shall reinstate Customer’s use of or access to the Services, as applicable, if Customer remediates the issue within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice. In addition and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Conduit may terminate this Agreement and any current Order Forms for any reason by providing Customer with ten (10) days prior written notice. </li><li>In addition to Section 3 and any other terms of this Agreement that explicitly survive termination, all provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, accrued payment obligations, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability. For clarity, any services provided by Conduit to Customer, including any assistance in exporting the Customer Data, shall be billable at Conduit’s standard rates then in effect.</li></ol></li><li>Indemnification. <ol role="list"><li>Each party (“<strong>Indemnitor</strong>”) shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the other party, its affiliates and each of its and its affiliates’ employees, contractors, directors, service providers, suppliers and representatives (collectively, the “<strong>Indemnitee</strong>”) from all liabilities, claims, and expenses paid or payable to an unaffiliated third party (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) (“<strong>Losses</strong>”), that arise from or relate to any claim that (i) the Customer Data or Customer’s use of the Services (in the case of Customer as Indemnitor), or (ii) the Services (in the case of Conduit as Indemnitor), infringes, violates, or misappropriates any third party intellectual property or proprietary right. Each Indemnitor’s indemnification obligations hereunder shall be conditioned upon the Indemnitee providing the Indemnitor with: (x) prompt written notice of any claim (provided that a failure to provide such notice shall only relieve the Indemnitor of its indemnity obligations if the Indemnitor is materially prejudiced by such failure); (y) the option to assume sole control over the defense and settlement of any claim (provided that the Indemnitee may participate in such defense and settlement at its own expense); and (z) reasonable information and assistance in connection with such defense and settlement (at the Indemnitor’s expense). </li><li>The foregoing obligations of Conduit do not apply with respect to the Services or any information, technology, materials or data (or any portions or components of the foregoing) to the extent (i) not created or provided by Conduit (including without limitation any Customer Data), (ii) made in whole or in part in accordance to Customer specifications, (iii) modified after delivery by Conduit, (iv) combined with other products, processes or materials not provided by Conduit (where the alleged Losses arise from or relate to such combination), (v) where Customer or any Authorized User continues allegedly infringing activity after being notified thereof or after being informed of modifications that would have avoided the alleged infringement, or (vi) Customer’s use of the Services is not strictly in accordance herewith. </li><li>THIS SECTION 13 SETS FORTH CUSTOMER’S SOLE REMEDIES AND CONDUIT’S SOLE LIABILITY AND OBLIGATION FOR ANY ACTUAL, THREATENED, OR ALLEGED CLAIMS THAT THE SERVICES INFRINGE, VIOLATE, OR MISAPPROPRIATE ANY THIRD PARTY’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR PROPRIETARY RIGHT.</li></ol></li><li>Disclaimers. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH HEREIN, THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” AND ARE WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND ANY WARRANTIES IMPLIED BY ANY COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, USAGE OF TRADE, OR COURSE OF DEALING, ALL OF WHICH ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED.</li><li>Limitation of Liability. EXCEPT FOR THE PARTIES’ INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS AND FOR CUSTOMER’S BREACH OF SECTION 2, IN NO EVENT SHALL CONDUIT, NOR ANY OF ITS DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, PARTNERS, SUPPLIERS OR CONTENT OR SERVICE PROVIDERS, BE LIABLE UNDER CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, NEGLIGENCE OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY WITH RESPECT TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT (I) FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, DATA LOSS, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER(II) FOR ANY IMPAIRMENT, INABILITY TO USE OR LOSS, INTERRUPTION, OR DELAY OF THE SERVICES, BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE (REGARDLESS OF THE SOURCE OF ORIGINATION), OR ANY LOSS OF GOODWILL OR REPUTATION OR (III) FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF (IN THE AGGREGATE) THE FEES PAID (OR PAYABLE) BY CUSTOMER TO CONDUIT HEREUNDER IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO A CLAIM HEREUNDER.</li><li>Material Changes to the Services. The Services may change over time, and Conduit reserves the right to introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. Conduit will use commercially reasonable efforts to give Customer notice prior to making a material change to the Services.</li><li>Miscellaneous. This Agreement (including all Order Forms and Exhibits hereto) represents the entire agreement between Customer and Conduit with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between Customer and Conduit with respect thereto. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and an Order Form, the Order Form shall control. The Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts of law rules, and the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts located in San Francisco, California. All notices under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; or the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service. Notices must be sent to the contacts for each party set forth on the Order Form. Either party may update its address set forth above by giving notice in accordance with this section. Except as otherwise provided herein, any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived only by a writing executed by both parties. Except for payment obligations, neither party shall be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond such party’s reasonable control, including, without limitation, the elements; fire; flood; severe weather; earthquake; vandalism; accidents; sabotage; power failure; denial of service attacks or similar attacks; Internet failure; acts of God and the public enemy; acts of war; acts of terrorism; riots; civil or public disturbances; strikes lock-outs or labor disruptions; any laws, orders, rules, regulations, acts or restraints of any government or governmental body or authority, civil or military, including the orders and judgments of courts.

No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment relationship is created as a result of this Agreement and neither party has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect. In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover costs and attorneys’ fees. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
