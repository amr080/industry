USE</h2><h3>Last updated: 13 September 2024</h3><p class="my-4">1. GENERAL</p><p>These terms and conditions (&quot;Terms&quot;) govern the use of the website https://stvol.io/ and all its associated subdomains and mobile applications (the &quot;Website&quot;) and the services available thereon (the &quot;Services&quot;).

These Terms constitute a binding and enforceable legal contract between stVol.io (&quot;the Company&quot;, &quot;we&quot; or &quot;us&quot;) and you, an end user of the Services (&quot;you&quot; or &quot;User&quot;).</p><p>Please note that the Protocol (as defined herein) is highly experimental in nature, is deploying for testing purpose, and you should not utilise the same for deployment of any substantial amount of digital assets. We do not give any warranties, whether express or implied, as to the suitability or usability of the Protocol, the Services, the Website, its software or any of its content. We will not be liable for any loss, whether such loss is direct, indirect, special or consequential, suffered by you or any party as a result of the use of the Protocol, the Services, the Website, or its content and functionalities.</p><p>By accessing, using or clicking the Website or accessing, using or attempting to use the Protocol, the Services or the Website, you agree that you have read, understood, and to are bound by these Terms and that you comply with the requirements listed herein. In addition, when using some features of the Services, you may be subject to specific additional terms and conditions applicable to those features.</p><p>Information contained in this Website is current as at the date of publication, and we may modify, suspend or discontinue the Website or the Services at any time and without notifying you. We may also change, update, add or remove provisions of these Terms from time to time. Any and all modifications or changes to these Terms will become effective upon publication on our Website or release to Users. Therefore, your continued use of the Services is deemed your acceptance of the modified Terms and rules. If you do not agree to any changes to these Terms, please do not access or use the Website or the Services. Our privacy policy, platform rules, guidelines and all other agreements entered into separately between you and us are deemed supplementary terms that are an integral part of these Terms and shall have the same legal effect. Your use of the Website or Services is deemed your acceptance of any supplementary terms too.</p><p>We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes to the Terms from time to time. We will alert you of any changes by updating the &quot;Last Updated&quot; date of these Terms (on the first page hereof), and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change. It is your responsibility to periodically review these Terms to stay informed of updates. You will be subject to and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to have accepted, the changes in any revised Terms by your continued use of the Website or the Services after the date such revised Terms are posted.</p><p>This Website and the Services are not available to residents of Afghanistan, American Samoa, Angola, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada, Central African Republic, Chad, China, Crimea of Ukraine, Cuba, Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of Korea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guam, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Laos, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Madagascar, Mali, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nicaragua, Northern Mariana Islands, Pakistan, Puerto Rico, Republic of the Congo, Russia, Somalia, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, Tajikistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkmenistan, Uganda, United States, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu, Venezuela, Virgin Islands (U.S.), Yemen, and Zimbabwe and any other jurisdiction in which accessing or using our protocol is prohibited (each a &quot;Restricted Country&quot;). We reserve the right to choose markets and jurisdictions to conduct business and may restrict or refuse the access of Website and the Services in other countries or regions in our sole discretion.</p><p>Without limiting the foregoing, by using the Website or the Services, you acknowledge and understand that laws regarding digital assets, derivatives, financial instruments, or investment products which may include digital assets, may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and it is your sole obligation to ensure that you fully comply with any law, regulation or directive, relevant to your jurisdiction with regard to the use of the Website or the Services. For the avoidance of doubt, the ability to access the Website or the Services does not necessarily mean that the same (or your activities through it) are legal under the laws, regulations or directives relevant to your jurisdiction.</p><p class="my-4"> 2. THE PROTOCOL</p><p>The &quot;stVol&quot; protocol (the Protocol) is a decentralised non-custodial derivatives trading platform comprised of smart-contracts deployed on the relevant blockchain network(s) that operate in a decentralised and autonomous manner, allowing any user to perform leveraged derivatives trades directly in a peer-to-peer manner. The list of supported currencies, assets, trading pairs, and rules for the functioning/settlement of derivatives would evolve from time to time as the Protocol undergoes continued development and improvement. The smart contracts may be visualised on a user interface provided on the Website that enables users to interact with the smart contracts to view their positions, trade leveraged derivatives, view their historical transactions, and deposit to or withdraw from the smart contracts. These smart-contracts can be reviewed, verified, used, copied, modified, and distributed by anyone (subject to the terms of the applicable license). Accordingly, there might be other interfaces enabling interaction with the Protocol that we neither control nor are affiliated with. Furthermore, anyone can interact directly with the Protocol bypassing interfaces provided. You should carefully and thoroughly review and assess the Protocol and related software before you use them, and any such use shall be at your own risk. You should always do your own research.</p><p>The Protocol shall be available on the Base blockchain network or more blockchain networks, and the list of such supported networks may evolve from to time. It is further expressly acknowledged that we neither control nor operate the Protocol. Information and materials about the Protocol available on the Website are provided for the information purposes only, are not binding and do not form a part of these Terms. All interactions between users, traders and market makers on the Protocol operate in a peer-to-peer manner on the relevant blockchain network. When users &quot;deposit&quot; digital assets, this represents a transaction whereby the user would place certain digital assets into the smart contracts together with a legal guarantee from the user that these will be utilised to settle any profits/losses accrued in respect of the user&#x27;s trades in leveraged derivatives with other users of the Protocol. The users enter into a direct contractual relationship via the autonomous smart contracts, and therefore traders wholly assume all responsibility towards the contractual counterparty to the trade.</p><p>You further acknowledge that we do not control the Protocol, its underlying blockchain networks, and any software through which such network is formed. The Company only provides the users with the Website being an interface to access the Protocol. We will have no insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. With that in mind, we will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via the Website, or any other transactions that you conduct via the Base network, or other blockchain networks. Accordingly, in no event shall the Company be responsible for said peer-to-peer direct contractual relationship nor construed as party thereto, nor held liable in connection with the Protocol, underlying blockchain networks or software, their operation, functioning, implementation, or use, and you hereby assume and accept any and all related risks, including the risk of possible losses and damages that you may incur in connection with the use thereof.</p><p class="my-4"> 3. NON-CUSTODIAL NATURE OF PROTOCOL</p><p>The Company never receives access to, operates, maintains, has custody or control over your digital wallet or digital assets held in such digital wallet, and has no ability to retrieve or transfer its content. Therefore, you are solely responsible for securing your digital wallet and credentials thereto (including private key, seed phrase, password, etc.). In the event that you lose access to your electronic wallet, private key(s), password(s), or other method(s) of securing your Wallet, all digital assets held in such wallet may be irretrievable, and the Company will be unable to assist you in any way.</p><p>The Company will not create any hosted wallet for you or otherwise custody digital assets on your behalf, and it is your sole responsibility to maintain the security of your selected electronic wallet. You may disconnect your digital wallet from the Website at any time.</p><p>You hereby irrevocably waive, release and discharge all claims, whether known or unknown to you, against the Company, its affiliates and their respective shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives related to your use of any wallet software, associated loss of digital assets, transaction failures, or any other defects that arise in the course of your use of your electronic wallet, including any losses that may obtain as a result of any failure of the Website or the Services.</p><p class="my-4"> 4. NOT AN INTERMEDIARY; NO CONTROL</p><p>You understand that the Website is independent from the Protocol, and provides a web-based means for users to interact with the smart contracts underlying the Protocol. Accordingly, our responsibilities are limited to the user&#x27;s functionality and availability of the Website.</p><p>We are not a counterparty, intermediary or broker of digital assets and neither are we a party to any peer-to-peer agreement for leveraged derivatives entered into between users.

RISKS</p><p>You should conduct your own due diligence of any issuer or cryptocurrencies and consult your advisors prior to making any decision to trade with the Protocol. You are solely responsible for determining whether any strategy, trade or related transaction is appropriate for you according to your personal objectives, financial circumstances and risk tolerance, and you shall be solely responsible for any loss or liability therefrom. You should consult legal or tax professionals regarding your specific situation.</p><p>We do not recommend that any cryptocurrencies should be bought, earned, sold, or held by you and we will not be held responsible for the decisions you make based on the information provided by us on this Website.</p><p>You acknowledge and agree that the Website and the Services are currently in the initial development stages and there are a variety of unforeseeable risks with utilising the foregoing. In the worst scenario, this could lead to the loss of all or part of your digital assets interacting with the Website or the Services. IF YOU DECIDE TO UTILISE THE WEBSITE OR THE SERVICES YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE, ACCEPT AND ASSUME THE BELOW RISKS AND AGREE NOT TO HOLD THE COMPANY OR ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FOLLOWING RISKS:</p><p>(a) You acknowledge and are aware that using the Website or the Services, and/or trading derivatives carry financial risk of such risks. Transactions relating to digital assets are very risky, and such digital assets are, by their nature, highly experimental, risky, volatile and generally irreversible.</p><p>(b) You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice and experience to make your own evaluation of the merits and risks of trading derivatives. You accept all consequences of participating in such interactions, including the risk that you may lose access to your digital assets indefinitely. All decisions to trade leveraged derivatives are made solely by you. Notwithstanding anything in these Terms, the Company accepts no responsibility whatsoever for and will in no circumstances be liable to you in connection with any interaction with the Website or the Services, or the trading of any derivatives.</p><p>(c) Digital assets and derivatives are not legal tender, are not backed by the government, and are not subject to any &quot;Deposit Insurance Scheme&quot; or protections under any banking or securities laws. The Company is not a bank and does not offer any lending services, fiduciary services, or security broking services.</p><p>(d) The prices of blockchain assets are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the value of derivatives, which may also be subject to significant price volatility. We cannot guarantee that any user trading derivatives will not lose money.</p><p>(e) Neither the Website nor the Services hold in custody, store, send, or receive any of your digital assets. This is because your digital assets exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the relevant blockchain network (e.g. Base). Any transfer of digital assets occurs within the relevant blockchain network, and not on the Website or the Services.</p><p>(f) All smart contracts may contain security vulnerabilities, errors, failures, bugs or economic loopholes which may be exploited by third parties, causing you to suffer losses in connection with any digital assets or bridged/wrapped assets utilised in connection with the smart contracts, the Website or the Services. Interaction with the Website and the Services are entirely at your own responsibility and liability, and the Company is not a party to the smart contracts. Further, when you interact with the Website or the Services and place an order to trade, the trade will be irrevocably confirmed once there is a matching bid/offer and you will not be able to withdraw the trade order.</p><p>(g) No party (including the Company) is able to guarantee the future performance of derivatives, any specific level of performance, the success of any strategy or your overall results from trading derivatives.
